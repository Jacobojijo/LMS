      },
      {
        "question": "What is the preferred position for the demonstrative in a Dholuo noun phrase?",
        "options": [
          "Before the head noun",
          "Immediately after the partitive article",
          "At the end of the phrase",

        "question": "Why is 'Nyithindo mohera tugo matindo moko ariyo ka' considered problematic?",
        "options": [
          "The demonstrative is missing",
          "The relative clause does not modify the correct noun",
          "The scope of 'matindo' is incorrectly assigned to 'tugo' instead of 'nyithindo'",
          "The quantifier is misplaced"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "The phrase is problematic because the scope of the adjective 'matindo' (small) is incorrectly assigned to 'tugo' (play) instead of 'nyithindo' (children). The adjective should modify the children, not the act of playing."

          "When the noun phrase contains no partitive article"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "The demonstrative is allowed immediately after the head noun when the head noun represents time, which is an exception to the general rule of demonstratives appearing at the end of the noun phrase."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "The phrase 'Nyithindo ariyo moko matindo mohero tugo ka' is an acceptable variation because it maintains the proper scope relationships while allowing some flexibility in the order of quantifiers (ariyo and moko)."

        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "The phrase 'Nyithindo matindo moko ariyo mohero tugo ka' demonstrates correct word order in a Dholuo noun phrase, with the head noun 'nyithindo' (children) followed by the adjective 'matindo' (small), quantifiers 'moko ariyo' (some two), relative clause 'mohero tugo' (who like to play), and the demonstrative 'ka' (these) at the end."
