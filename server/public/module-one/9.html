        <h3>1.5 Adjectives</h3>
        
        <h4>1.5.1 Introduction</h4>
        <p>In Dholuo grammar, adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns by providing additional information about their qualities, characteristics, or states. Adjectives help to specify the size, color, shape, quantity, or condition of a noun. They enrich communication by adding detail and precision to sentences.</p>
        
        <h4>1.5.2 Adjectives and Adjective Clauses</h4>
        <p>The distinction between verbs and adjectives is not clearly defined in linguistics. Outside language-specific considerations of morphological possibilities for word-classification and differentiation, there is only the semantic idea that verbs generally predicate events whereas adjectives generally predicate. But even here there are problems of overlap, for while adjectives have the function, by definition, of predicating states, a number of verbs or words which otherwise behave like verbs are often capable of predicating for example, in the sentences:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Dienda olal</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'My goat is lost.'</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>Dienda echo lal.</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'There is my goat getting lost.'</span></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The word <strong>[lal]</strong> may be regarded either as a verb or an adjective depending on whether we understand it (in a given context) to mean 'to get lost' or 'to be lost'. It does not help to regard the second interpretation as that of a stative verb because, by so doing, we exclude the possibility of having a sentence such as (b) which expresses a non-stative situation. Of course, this is a case of something that belongs to the grey area between two grammatical categories and is likely to remain controversial for a long time.</p>
        
        <p>Accordingly, we shall regard as adjectives those words which predicate only states. Unmodified, Dholuo adjectives can have only a predicative function, e.g.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Dhiang' ber</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'A cow is good'</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>Punda rach</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'A donkey is bad'</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>Kwach ger</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'A leopard is fierce'</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>Dala bor</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'Home is far away'</span></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The predicative idea is only semantic (and not syntactic) in Dholuo because adjectives, whether predicative or attributive, occur postpositionally. The attributive function is performed by adjectives in the form of minimal or one-word relative clauses in which, as usual, the clitic <strong>ma</strong> functions as a relativizer, e.g.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Dhiang' ma-ber</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'a cow which (is) good' (a good cow)</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>Punda ma-rach</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'a donkey which (is) bad' (a bad donkey)</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>Kwach ma-ger</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'a leopard which (is) fierce' (a fierce leopard)</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>Piny ma-bor</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'a country which (is) far (away)' (a far (away) country)</span></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p>Although elementary grammars refer to forms like <strong>[maber]</strong> as adjectives, I find it more accurate to regard them as relative clauses, albeit (structurally) minimal ones. By so doing we capture the generalization contained in the observation that the clitic <strong>[ma]</strong> is used in all relative clauses in the language.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The following sentences exemplify this idea:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Yien ma wiye owang'</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'a tree whose top is burnt'</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>Jaduong' ma ohero pesa</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'an elder who likes money'</span></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Phonologically, <strong>[ma + ohero]</strong> is often realized as <strong>[mohero]</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Typologically, this is not an unusual phenomenon, given that even in cases like that of English in which no relativizer appears in attributive constructions (e.g. 'a good man'), such phrases are derived from underlying relative clauses (in this case, 'a man who is good').</p>
        
        <p>A characteristic feature of predication in Dholuo is that it is direct, making use of no copula. For example, in a sentence such as:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Opiyo riek</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'Opiyo is clever.'</span></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>only word-order establishes the relationship between the two words used. Where a nominal and an adjective are involved, the reverse word-order to that of (a) would produce a non-sentence. Thus:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p class="invalid"><strong>* riek Opiyo</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>is syntactically ill-formed and semantically anomalous. The ability of nouns, especially common ones, to function both as subjects and as predicates allows us to have word-order-based minimal pairs such as:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Japuonj jajuok</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'The teacher is a wizard.'</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>Jajuok japuonj</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'The wizard is a teacher.'</span></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>A slight complication arises from the fact that personal pronouns seem to be capable of functioning as a copula, giving us sentences like:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Japuonj en jajuok</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'The teacher is a wizard.'</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>Dhok gin mwandu</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'Cattle are wealth.'</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>Kuo en richo</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'Theft is sin.'</span></p>
            
            <p><strong>Nyithindo gin gweth</strong><br>
            <span class="translation">'Children are a blessing.'</span></p>
