            <h3>2.4 Review & Practice</h3>
            <h4>2.4.1 Summary of Verbs & Adpositions</h4>
            
            <h4>Verbs in Dholuo</h4>
            <p>Verbs in Dholuo function as symbols for events, changes of state, processes, actions, and speaker intentions. Unlike English, where a verb is essential for a well-formed sentence, Dholuo allows verb-less constructions, as seen in:</p>
            <div class="example">Peter japuonj ('Peter is a teacher')</div>
            <div class="example">Peter ber ('Peter is good')</div>
            
            <h4>Criteria for Identifying Verbs in Dholuo</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Function:</strong> Verbs represent events or states of affairs.</li>
                <li><strong>Morphological Behavior:</strong> Verbs show aspectual distinctions tonally or segmentally.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For instance, in:</p>
            <div class="example">Juma ofuwo ('Juma is foolish'), the verb fuwo takes a perfective marker (o-).</div>
            <div class="example">Juma ber ('Juma is good'), ber does not show aspectual variation, marking it as an adjective.</div>
            
            <h4>Tense in Dholuo</h4>
            <p>Tense encodes the temporal relation between an event and the time of utterance. In Dholuo, it is expressed both lexically and grammatically. Key lexical markers include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Past:</strong> Nene (remote), Nende (near past), Nyoro (yesterday), Nyocha (day before yesterday)</li>
                <li><strong>Future:</strong> Kiny (tomorrow), Orucha (day after tomorrow), Chieng' (remote future)</li>
                <li><strong>Present & Immediate Timeframes:</strong> Kawuono (today), Sani/Tinende (now), Ang'/Wang' (near future)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Idiomatic expressions also modify tense, such as a-a ('just now') and a-biro nene ('soon'). Some markers, like sani and koro, are interchangeable in certain contexts.</p>
            
            <h4>Negation in Dholuo</h4>
            <p>Negation is primarily marked by ok, which negates not just the verb but often the entire proposition.</p>
            <div class="example">Ok adwar chiemo ('I don't want food') negates the full statement Adwaro chiemo ('I want food').</div>
            <p>However,</p>
            <div class="example">chiemo e ma ok adwar ('It is food that I don't want') narrows negation to chiemo ('food').</div>
            <p>Similarly,</p>
            <div class="example">Opiyo e ma ok dwar chiemo ('It is Opiyo who doesn't want food') restricts negation to Opiyo.</div>
            
            <h4>Reflexive Verbs in Dholuo</h4>
            <p>Reflexive verbs in Dholuo are marked by the morpheme -rV, where -r- is the reflexive marker and -V is a person-specific vowel:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>-a (1st Person Sg.)</li>
                <li>-i (2nd Person Sg.)</li>
                <li>-e (3rd Person Sg. /Pl., 1st Person Pl.)</li>
                <li>-u (2nd Person Pl.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The form -e is unmarked and can replace the other person markers.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <div class="example">Ahinyor-a/e ('I have hurt myself')</div>
            <div class="example">Ibinyor-i/e ('You have hurt yourself')</div>
            <div class="example">Ohinyor-e ('He/She has hurt himself/herself')</div>
            <div class="example">Wahinyor-e ('We have hurt ourselves')</div>
            <div class="example">Uhinyor-u/e ('You have hurt yourselves')</div>
            <div class="example">Gihinyor-e ('They have hurt themselves')</div>
            
            <p>In citation, reflexive verbs typically end in -e (e.g., hinyore 'to hurt oneself'), but native speakers often use -ruok constructions (e.g., hinyruok 'self-harm'). This distinction is evident in phrases like:</p>
            <div class="example">Hinyruok rach ('To hurt oneself is bad')</div>
            <div class="example">Tuonruok tek ('Self-denial is difficult')</div>
            
            <h4>True Reflexive and Reciprocal Constructions</h4>
            <p>True reflexives in Dholuo occur when the subject and object refer to the same entity, as in:</p>
            <div class="example">Dhiang' nang'ore ('The cow is licking itself').</div>
            <p>Reciprocal constructions indicate mutual actions between participants:</p>
            <div class="example">Otieno gi Apiyo oherore ('Otieno and Apiyo love each other').</div>
            <p>Ambiguity arises in cases like</p>
            <div class="example">Dhok nang'ore ('Cows are licking themselves/one another')</div>
            <p>where context determines whether the meaning is reflexive or reciprocal.</p>
            
            <h4>Impersonal Constructions</h4>
            <p>Dholuo reflexive verbs also form impersonal constructions, shifting focus from the actor to the action itself. These are categorized as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Event-oriented:</strong> Emphasizes the occurrence of an action (Odi mukore – 'Your house is crumbling').</li>
                <li><strong>Actor-oriented:</strong> Identifies an unspecified actor (Imuko odi – 'Your house is being knocked down').</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A scale of actor-explicitness exists, with</p>
            <div class="example">Ng'ato muko odi ('Someone is knocking down your house')</div>
            <p>being more actor-oriented than</p>
            <div class="example">Imuko odi</div>
            
            <p>Some reflexive constructions function figuratively to emphasize large-scale events</p>
            <div class="example">Kong'o madhore ka ('People are drinking beer here')</div>
            <p>often implying social commentary.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, reflexive verb forms indicate an object's capacity for action:</p>
            <div class="example">Chuma ni ng'adore ('This metal can be cut').</div>
            
            <h4>Adpositions in Dholuo</h4>
            <p>Adpositions establish relationships between linguistic elements, indicating their syntactic and semantic connections. In Dholuo, only prepositions exist, marking locative, instrumental, directional, and beneficiary relationships.</p>
            
            <h4>1. Locative Prepositions</h4>
            <p>Locative expressions in Dholuo often use the copula ni combined with e (a general locative marker) and optional elements (X) for specificity. Examples include:</p>
            <div class="example">Pala ni ka – 'The knife is here.'</div>
            <div class="example">Rombe ni e pap – 'The sheep are in the field.'</div>
            <p>The preposition kuom ('on') is used for living beings, whereas e remains for inanimate objects.</p>
            
            <h4>2. Instrumental Prepositions</h4>
            <p>The preposition gi ('with') introduces an instrument:</p>
            <div class="example">Oloo kunyo bur gi beti – 'Oloo is digging a hole with a machete.'</div>
            <p>It also conveys means</p>
            <div class="example">Wadhi Mombasa gi gari – 'We are going to Mombasa by train'</div>
            <p>accompaniment</p>
            <div class="example">Nyathi nindo gi min – 'The child is sleeping with its mother'</div>
            <p>and equipment</p>
            <div class="example">Odhi e pwodho gi kweru – 'He is going to the farm with a hoe'</div>
            
            <h4>3. Directional Prepositions</h4>
            <p>Dholuo generally omits prepositions when movement is unspecified</p>
            <div class="example">Dhi nam – 'Go to the lake'</div>
            <p>but e is used for specific locations</p>
            <div class="example">Dhi e dho nam – 'Go to the lakeshore'</div>
            <p>The preposition ir ('to') is applied only for human destinations</p>
            <div class="example">Nyithindo dhi ir japuonj – 'The children are going to the teacher'</div>
            <p>while yo ('towards') indicates movement without a definite destination</p>
            <div class="example">Japuonj odhi yo Kisumu – 'The teacher has gone towards Kisumu'</div>
            
            <h4>4. Beneficiary, Loser, and Sufferer Roles</h4>
            <p>The preposition ni/ne marks various roles, depending on the verb:</p>
            <div class="example">Ng'ato ong'iewo ne nyathi pala – 'Someone has bought a knife for the child' (beneficiary).</div>
            <div class="example">Ng'ato olalo ne nyathi pala – 'Someone has lost the child's knife' (loser).</div>
            <div class="example">Ng'ato ogolo ne nyathi pala – 'Someone has drawn a knife to attack the child' (sufferer).</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="divider"></div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>2.5 Adverbials</h3>
            <h4>2.5.1 Introduction</h4>
            <p>In Dholuo grammar, adverbials are linguistic elements that modify verbs, adjectives, or entire sentences by providing additional information about time, place, manner, frequency, degree, reason, and purpose. Adverbials help specify the circumstances of an action, making speech more precise and contextually rich.</p>
            <p>In this approach, adverbs are sub classified in terms of what they predicate or are predications over. The subclasses are:</p>
            
            <h4>2.5.2 Predictions over Events, Actions and Propositions</h4>
            <h4>Predictions over Events, Actions</h4>
            <p>This includes such adverbial functions as:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Locative</strong> - which indicates where something is located, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Ng'ato nindo e tiend yath ('Someone is sleeping under the tree')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Directional</strong> - which indicates the physical orientation or direction of a static or moving body as the case may be, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Od sikul ochung' ka ochomo nam. ('The school building stands facing the lake.')</div>
            <div class="example">Nyithindo dhi (e) sikul ('Children are going to school.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Durative</strong> - which shows the duration of a given event, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Ne gitiyo (kuom) higni apar ('They worked for ten years.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Extent</strong> - which shows the spatial equivalent of duration, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Asewuotho mael abich ('I have walked five miles.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Point time</strong> - which marks the time at which an event takes place, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Kenyatta notho higa mokalo ('Kenyatta died last year.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Manner</strong> - which indicates the way in which an event takes place, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Gari ringo matek ('The train goes fast.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Instrument</strong> - which indicates what is employed (usually as a tool) in carrymg out something, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Andiko gi kalam ('I am writing with a pen.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Accompaniment</strong> - which indicates that one nominal acts as an accompanying participant to another nominal, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Aloo dhi nam gi wuon ('Aloo is going to the lake with her father.')</div>
            
            <p>The word gi 'with' in (a) above is homophonous to the gi 'and' which occurs in the following sentence.</p>
            <div class="example">Aloo gi wuon dhii nam ('Aloo and her father are going to the lake.')</div>
            <p>where Aloo gi wuon is a compound subject.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Equipment</strong> - which, although introduced by the same form gi, indicates what one equips himself with for some intended purpose, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Aloo dhi nam gi ndoo. ('Aloo is going to the lake with a pail' (e.g. to draw water))</div>
            
            <p><strong>Means</strong> - which shows how one achieves a certain purpose (in expressions which adopt an adverbial strategy for showing it), e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Adhi ikul gi tienda ('I go to school on foot')</div>
            
            <h4>Predictions over Propositions</h4>
            <p>Unlike in the above cases, where the scope of the adverbial element is limited only to some part of the proposition, usually the action or state designated by the verb, in the case we are dealing with now the sentence in question has a whole proposition which can be shown to fall withm the scope of a given adverbial expression. The adverbial functions under this category include:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Factive</strong> - which indicates that a given proposition is believed by the speaker to be a fact, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Kiwacho adieri (to) Jo-Kenya ohero pesa. ('Truly speaking, Kenyans love money.')</div>
            <div class="example">Ka ok ariambo (to) koth biro chwe kawuono ('If I don't lie, it will rain today.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Modality</strong> - which indicates the speaker's attitude towards what he says, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Ka nyalore (to) Onyango biro duogo. ('If (it is) possible Onyango will come back.')</div>
            <div class="example">Ka de to ngàto de okonyo ng'atni. ('It would be good if someone could help this man.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Concession</strong> - which introduces a proposition contrary to what should be expected from known facts, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Kata aonge pesa to nyaka abed gi ot. ('Even if I lack have money I must have a house.')</div>
            <div class="example">Wayie ni okwelo to ok unyal nege. ('We agree that he has stolen, but you can't kill him.')</div>
        </div>
