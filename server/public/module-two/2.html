        <h3>2.1.2 Tense and Negation</h3>
        
        <h4>Tense</h4>
        <p>The essential characteristic of the category of tense is that it relates the time of the action, event or state of affairs referred to in the sentence to the time of utterance (the time of utterance being 'now').</p>
        
        <p>Like other deictic categories, tense is encoded in language both lexically and grammatically. The lexical items which relate linguistic messages in Dholuo to the relevant speech context in terms of time are as follows:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Nene - Remote past</li>
            <li>Nende - Near past (within the same day)</li>
            <li>Nyoro - Yesterday</li>
            <li>Nyocha - The day before yesterday</li>
            <li>Kiny - Tomorrow</li>
            <li>Orucha - The day after tomorrow</li>
            <li>Kawuono - Today</li>
            <li>Sani, Tinende - Now</li>
            <li>Ang'/wang' - Near future (within the same day)</li>
            <li>Chieng' - Remote Future</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>In addition to these, there are idiomatic expressions involving the words [a] 'to come from' and [biro] 'to come (to)' for immediate past and immediate future, respectively. Thus, for example, the English sentence 'I've just seen him a while ago' can be rendered in Dholuo as:</p>
        
        <p class="example">A-a nene machiegni</p>
        <p class="translation">'I've just seen him a while ago'</p>
        
        <p class="example">A-biro nene machiegni</p>
        <p class="translation">'I'll see him soon'</p>
        
        <p>Moreover, a number of the words in (a) - j) above have synonymous expressions. For instance, [nende] is often replaced by a long 'i', as in:</p>
        
        <p class="example">aanene kawuono gokinyi</p>
        <p class="translation">'I saw him today in the morning.'</p>
        
        <p>and [sani] is, in many contexts, mutually interchangeable with [koro], e.g. 'Now John may come' can be expressed in Dholuo either as a) or (b).</p>
        
        <p class="example">John koro nyalo biro</p>
        <p class="example">John sani nyalo biro</p>
        
        <h4>Negation</h4>
        <p>There are many lexical items that have a negative sense in Dholuo. The choice to give [ok] a special treatment is based on two grounds.</p>
        
        <p>First, it can justifiably be regarded as the marker of negation in Dholuo. Secondly, and more significantly, is the fact that it is one of the constituents whose ordering problems are dealt with later in this study.</p>
        
        <p>Although [ok] is usually associated with the verbal element in a given construction its real scope is often the whole predication, as in the sentence:</p>
        
        <p class="example">Ok adwar chiemo</p>
        <p class="translation">'I don't want food.'</p>
        
        <p>Here what is negated can be understood as the whole propositional content of the parallel sentence</p>
        
        <p class="example">Adwaro chiemo</p>
        <p class="translation">I want food.</p>
        
        <p>and, in this way, it differs from a sentence such as</p>
        
        <p class="example">Chiemo e ma ok adwar</p>
        <p class="translation">'It is food that I don't want.'</p>
        
        <p>in which the scope of [ok] is only [chiemo], or one like:</p>
        
        <p class="example">Opiyo e ma ok dwar chiemo</p>
        <p class="translation">'It is Opiyo who doesn't want food.'</p>
        
        <p>where only Opiyo falls within the scope of [ok].</p>
        <p>Problems of this nature will be discussed at length when we come to deal with pragmatic functions in Dholuo.</p>
