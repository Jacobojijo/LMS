        "options": [
          "They function as auxiliary verbs",
          "They serve as interrogative pronouns",
          "They act as Q-elements with a questioning function",
          "They replace subject nouns in a sentence"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "These Q-words serve a questioning function, making them Q-elements in Dholuo syntax."

        "question": "Which of the following statements about [donge] is true based on its surface positioning?",
        "options": [
          "It can only appear before the verb in a sentence.",
          "It is strictly a sentence-final element.",

        "explanation": "[Donge] is flexible in placement but cannot freely appear immediately after verbs."

      {
        "question": "Why are some sentence constructions with [donge] marked as ungrammatical?",
        "options": [
          "Because [donge] can only appear at the start of a sentence.",
          "Because it cannot occur in the middle of the sentence disrupting syntactic flow.",
          "Because it can only modify verb phrases directly.",
          "Because it does not function as an independent constituent."
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Positioning [donge] mid-sentence inappropriately can disrupt syntactic flow, leading to ungrammaticality."

        "options": [
          "[Nang’o] can freely occur at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence.",

        "question": "Which of the following correctly illustrates an acceptable sentence structure involving [nang’o]?",

        "question": "Why is the sentence \"Maria chamo rech e jikon nang’o kawuono?\" more acceptable to some speakers?",
        "options": [
          "Because the placement of [kawuono] before the verb increases acceptability.",
          "Because [nang’o] functions better when it directly modifies a noun.",
          "Because it follows the rule of [bende] and [donge] positioning.",
          "Because it eliminates the need for a subject in the sentence."
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "The repositioning of temporal elements like [kawuono] improves the sentence’s flow and acceptability."

        "question": "What can be concluded about the general syntactic behavior of Q-words in Dholuo?",
        "options": [
          "They are strictly bound to a fixed sentence position.",
          "They follow a completely random distribution in sentence structures.",
          "They exhibit some flexibility but follow distinct positional constraints.",
          "They do not affect sentence structure and can be omitted without altering meaning."
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Q-words in Dholuo show positional variation, but within structured syntactic limits."
