        <h2>4.1 Some Other Constituents</h2>
        <h3>4.1.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>All the principles and descriptive strategies required for providing an adequate account of Dholuo constituent order have been illustrated in the discussion of the ordering problems presented in the first eight sections of this chapter.</p>
        <p>However, for the sake of completeness, we shall discuss here the ordering of three other constituents which seem to have a conspicuous place in Dholuo grammar</p>
        
        <h3>4.1.2 Conditional Clause</h3>
        <p>The conditional clause in Dholuo is signalled by the clause-bound morpheme [ka], whose semantic range covers the senses of both 'if' and 'when' in English. (This semantic problem will be ignored here since it does not have any distributional consequences in Dholuo.) The positioning of this clause is illustrated by the following paraphrases.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ka ng'ato dwaro chiemo to (mondo) otedi.<br>
            'If someone wants food, (then) let him cook.'
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Ng'ato ka dwaro chiemo to (mondo) otedi
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Ng'ato (mondo)otedi ka odwaro chiemo
        </div>
        
        <p>Only (a) and (c) show variation in the positions of the clause. The variation represented by (b) involves only [ka] (as a single-word constituent) and the alpha term (in this case ng'ato). This is accounted for by the freedom of occurrence which [ka] has in relation to the nominal constituent that occurs in the preverbal position.</p>
        
        <p>Notice that such a constituent need not be an alpha term, as we can see in the following example, where (in (b) and (c)) a Go term standing in the P! position (as a result of Top assignment) behaves like [ng'ato] in (a, b, c) above.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ka oriemb japuonj to an bende aa.<br>
            'If the teacher is sent away (then) I'll also go.'
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Ka japuonj oriembi to an bende aa.<br>
            Go Top
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Japuonj ka oriembi to an bende aa.<br>
            Go Top
        </div>
        
        <p>(The difference between [oriemb] and [oriembi] is phonologically conditioned, and should be ignored here.)</p>
        
        <p>This freedom of [ka] around the preverbal nominal consffilent is usually restricted to the left-most of such constituents. Thus, for instance, we can have either the patterns in (a, b) or those in (c, d), but pattern (e), even to those native speakers who accept it (not the writer), is doubtful.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ka guok onego paka to wan gi chandruok<br>
            'If the dog kills the cat (then) we shall be in trouble.'
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Guok ka onego paka to wan gi chandruok.
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Ka paka guok one-go to wan gi chandruok.<br>
            Go Top
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Paka ka guok onego to wan gi chandruok.<br>
            Go Top
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Paka guok ka onego to wan gi chandruok.
        </div>
        
        <p>that an arrangement that places [ka] before guck in (e) will produce the same pattern as (d)</p>
        
        <p>We can thus say that the pattern of (Ng'ato ka dwaro chiemo to (mondo) otedi) is accounted for by the freedom of [ka] around the left-most preverbal nominal constituent. This leaves us with the variation between (Ka ng'ato dwaro chiemo to (mondo)) and (Ng'ato (mondo)otedi ka odwaro chiemo) as the only ordering problem involving the conditional clause proper.</p>
        
        <p>This same pattern variation is observed in the following paraphrases.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ka koth chwe to kik uluok lewni<br>
            'If it is raining, do not wash the clothes.'
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Kik uluok lewni ka koth chwe
        </div>
        
        <p>Now, as we observed, the conditional clause is, in tenns of syntactic categories, an adverbial element. Moreover, it is a kind of adverbial constituent whose scope (of modification) is the whole of the independent clause to which it is appended. This means that in the FG frame-work the conditional clause is an adverbial satellite term with the SF of Conditional (Con.).</p>
        
        <p>We can, therefore, generalize the derivational observations made with respect to (a, b) above as follows:</p>
        
        <p>Given any underlying predication (Q) which is (fiuther) extended by a conditional satellite (S), the resulting (underlying) predication QS will by the appropriate expression rules be realized on the surface either as</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            [Ka] S to [mondo] Q<br>
            or<br>
            Q [ka] S
        </div>
        
        <p>The conditions governing where [mondo] may or may not optionally occur will be stated in the lexical enry of the word [mondo] itself.</p>
        
        <p>Although rule above will take caree of the majority of our derivational requirements involving conditional clauses, it seems to need one restriction. It will be realized that from (b) above it is possible to have a situation in which Q already contains a conditional satellite before it is further extended by (another) S. This could give us a sentence such as:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Kain gi kuon to pogae ka ok otinni.<br>
            'If you have ugali (please) give me some if it is not too little for you (to share).'
        </div>
        
        <p>It is not common to have more than two conditional clauses in one Dholuo sentence. This seems to be merely a matter of taste or our natural tendency to avoid too much embedding. Though not so frequently, one occasionally hears sentences such as:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ka in gi pesa to wadhi e duka ka meru ok nyal dhaw kaobiro oyudo ka waonge<br>
            'If you have money then let us go to the shop (shops) if your mother cannot complain if she comes and finds us absent'
        </div>
        
        <p>(Notice that the ka in ka waonge is temporal rather than conditional.)</p>
        
        <p>Now, notice that a variation of (a-above) which starts with the second conditional clause [*ka ok otinni] is surely ill-formed. One is, therefore, tempted to think that the ordering freedom stated in (principles) above is in some way restricted if there are two (or more) conditional clauses in one sentence.</p>
        
        <p>But before we draw our conclusions, let us consider the following paraphrases, which show some patterns that would be unacceptable if the restriction suggested above were actually there.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ka in gi kuon to pognae ka meru ok nyal dhaw<br>
            'If you have ugali (then) give me some if your mother will (can) not
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Ka meru ok nyal dhaw to pognae kuon ka in go
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Ka meru ok nyal dbaw to ka in gi kuon to pognae
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Ka in gi kuon to ka meru ok nyal dhaw to pognae
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            *Ka in go to pognae kuon ka meru ok nyal dhaw
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            In go to ka meru ok nyal dhaw to pognae kuon
        </div>
    </div>
