        <h3>3.2.1.5 Focus</h3>
        <p>A typology of the various uses to which the Focus function can be put in a language in what is called "the etics" of Focus, in the sense that it idenffies the various ways in which Focus can manifest itself, without necessarily implying that these different ways are coded in dissimilar grammatical constructions in natural languages.</p>
        
        <p>Ignoring the higher levels of contrast in the differentiation of Focus types we can have the following six ultimate types, namely:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Completive Focus</strong> - which we speak of "when the Focus information is meant to fill in a gap in the pragmatic information of the addressee".</li>
            <li><strong>Selective Focus</strong> - which we speak of "when the Focus information selects one item from among a presupposed set of possible values"</li>
            <li><strong>Replacing Focus</strong> - which we speak of in cases in which a specific item in the pragmatic information of the addressee is removed and replaced by another, correct item.</li>
            <li><strong>Expanding focus</strong> - which we speak of in cases in which the Focus information is meant to be added to the antecedently given presupposed information.</li>
            <li><strong>Restricting Focus</strong> - which is a type of Focus by which an antecedently given presupposed set is restricted to one or more correct values.</li>
            <li><strong>Parallel Focus</strong> - which we speak of in cases in which a speaker constrasts two pieces of information within one linguistic expression.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The common factor in all these types of Focus is that they are all assigned to information-bearing elements. These six 'etics' of Focus can thus be seen as specifications of conditions under which an element in a predication can be regarded as information-bearing or, more as bearing the most salient piece of Information in a given set of pragmatic conditions.</p>
        
        <p>Dholuo does not formally (morphologically) mark all the various types of Focus defined above. Our interest here is only in the formal marking of Focus, whatever may be its particular 'etic' in the typology outlined above.' The Focus marker per excellence in Dholuo is the element [e8] as in:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Otieno e wuoyi.
            'Otieno is the boy.'</div>
            
        <p>The ordinary parallel of (a) is:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Otieno wuoyi.
           'Otieno is a boy.'</div>
           
        <p>While (b) merely states the sex of Otieno, (a) asserts that Otieno, as opposed to some other boy or boys, is the one who has the real quality of what is expected of a boy.</p>
        
        <p>When only emphasis and not Focus is intended, the masculinity of Otieno (or any other boy for that matter) can be commended by the assertion of (b) in a situation the addressee is already aware of Otieno's sex and the only reason for one to remind him of it would be to stress its special nature.</p>
        
        <p>It is common in Dholuo for the head term in a relative clause to be left out or, more technically, to remain a term variable after term insertion (in the formation of a predication). This normally leads to a juxtaposition of the Focus element e and the relativizer [ma]. Thus, a predication such as:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Otieno e ng'at ma nyalo konyowa
           'Otieno is the person who can help us.'</div>
           
        <p>is usually expressed as:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Otieno e ma nyalo konyowa</div>
        
        <p>While in such cases the separate functions of [e] and [ma] are clear, there are cases where [ma] may be said to support [e] in Focus marking. Thus, for example, in the Focus construction:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Chunya e ma rach
           'I am just in low spirits (i.e., nothing else is wrong with me)'</div>
           
        <p>One cannot easily think of what the unrealized head of the relative clause could be. Moreover, Focus constructions involving some question words contain only [ma] and cannot possibly have [e] as a Focus marker. This is what we see in:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Ang'o ma nyathino dwaro kanyo? 
          'What does that child want there?'</div>
          
        <p>Thus, until further investigation throws more light on this matter, we shall assume that Focus is variously marked in Dholuo by [e], [ma], or the combination [e ma].</p>
        
        <p>Underlyingly, the term assigned the Focus function is marked as such in order for the surface realization rules to place it in the right position, immediately following it with the appropriate Focus element.</p>
