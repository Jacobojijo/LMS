        <h3>3.2.1 Pragmatic Functions</h3>
        
        <h4>3.2.1.1 Introduction</h4>
        <p>In FG pragmatic functions (PFs) are assigned after syntactic functions to 'mark the informational status of constituents in question, withm the particular setting in which they are used'.</p>
        
        <p>Of the four pragmatic functions distinguished in FG, two are external to the predication proper while the other two are internal. The external PFs are Theme and Tail, and the internal ones are Topic and Focus defines these PFs as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Theme specifies the universe of discourse with respect to which the subsequent predication iS presented as relevant.</li>
            <li>The Tail presents, as an 'afterthought' to preceding predication, information meant to clarify, or it in various ways.</li>
            <li>The Topic presents the entity about which the predication predicates something in the given setting.</li>
            <li>The Focus presents what is relatively the most important or salient information in the given setting.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>3.2.1.2 Themes & Tail</h4>
        
        <h4>Themes</h4>
        <p>The schema used in Functional Grammar for 'introducing predications preceded by Themes and/or followed by Tails' is where the constituents bearing Theme and Tail functions are 'optional additions to the predication'.</p>
        
        <p>The following are examples of Dholuo utterances which have constituents with Theme function (italicized).</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <span class="italic">Nyako ma biro no</span> en osiepni?<br>
            'That coming girl, is she your friend?'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <span class="italic">Nanga ma ng'ich no</span> duoke<br>
            'That wet dress, return it outside.'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <span class="italic">In</span>, in jakuo<br>
            'You, you are a thief.'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <span class="italic">Wan</span>, wan jo mohero somo<br>
            'We, we are people who like education.'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <span class="italic">Joluo</span>, gin gikia ohala<br>
            'The Luo, they do not know business matters.'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <span class="italic">Oloo</span>, en oonge gi weche mathoth<br>
            'Oloo, he does not have many words (is peaceful).'
        </div>
        
        <p>In each of the examples (a-e) the italicized constituent specifies a universe of discourse which defines the set of objects with regard to which what is said in the immediately following predication is relevant. Thus, for example, the assertion made in the predication [gin gikia weche ohala] is shown to apply only to Joluo in (e).</p>
        
        <h4>Tail</h4>
        <p>The Tail occurs to the right of a predication which is already complete in itself and, as an afterthought, gives further information about it (or part of it). Examples show cases in which a pause may precede the Tail but is not always necessary and is usually avoided:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ok adware, wiye duong' no<br>
            'I don't want him, that big-headed one.'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Oonge paro, jakong'o no<br>
            'He is senseless, that drunkard'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ohero koko, en<br>
            'He likes noise, him.'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Kik isud buta, in<br>
            'Don't move near me, you.'
        </div>
        
        <p>In the following cases, a pause is necessary:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Macha e japuonj, ma wiye oyugno cha<br>
            'That is the teacher, that bushy-haired one'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Mano e maber, ma ok miya tich matek<br>
            'That is the good (one), which does not give me hard work'
        </div>
        
        <p>Constituents with Tail function can be placed within the predication. For example, (e) may be constructed with the Tail element occurring parenthetically as in:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Macha, ma wiye oyugno cha, e japuonj
        </div>
        
        <p>In both (e) and (g) the constituent with Tail function is added to give further information on what is referred to by the demonstrative pronoun of [macha].</p>
    </div>
