        <h2>3.2.3 Expression of Semantic & Pragmatic Functions</h2>
        <h3>Expression of Semantic Functions</h3>
        <p>The following expression rules are required to relate SFS (Systemic Functional Grammar) to their corresponding prepositional markers in the surface structure.</p>
        <p>If the SF of a term is Ø, PO, Fo, Proc, or Dir (where there is no content-word preposition), then there is zero prepositional marking for the term, e.g.:</p>
        <div class="example">Nyithindo dhi nam (Direction)<br>'The children are gomg to the lake.'</div>
        <p>If the SF of a term is Poss, and the possessed element is singular, then the term is immediately preceded by mar, e.g.:</p>
        <div class="example">Pesa ni mar japidi(Possesion)<br>'This money (sg.) belongs to the nurse.'</div>
        <p>If the SF of a term is Poss, and the possessed element is plural, then the term is immediately preceded by mag, e.g.:</p>
        <div class="example">Pesa gi mag japidi (Possesion)<br>This money (pl.) belongs to the nurse.'</div>
        <p>If the SF of a term is Companion or Instruction, then the term is immediately preceded by (gi), e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">Nyathi wuotho gi min (Companion)<br>The child is walking with its mother.'</div>
        <p>If the SF of a term is Ben or Rec, then the term is immediately preceded by ne, e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">Ang'iewo buk ne nyathina. (Ben)<br>I have bought a book for my child.'</div>
        <p>If the SF of a term is Loc, So, or Dirirection (Where there is a content-word preposition), then the term is immediately preceded by [e], e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">Aketo chiemo e wi mesa (Loc)<br>'I've placed food on the table.'</div>
        <p>One preposition whose realization has not been dealt with here is the non-target Direction marker [yo]. This preposition is better treated as a content-word preposition though it has the properties of both a specific and a general preposition. Like the latter, it does not allow any other general preposition to accompany it. Thus, only predications like (a) are well formed, and not those like (b).</p>
        <div class="example">Adeno odhi yo sikul<br>'Atieno has gone in the direction of the school.'</div>
        <div class="example">*Afieno odhi e yo sikul</div>
        <p>But, like content-word prepositions, it goes to the preverbal position with its term, normally necessitating the suffixing of the general preposition e to the verbal predicate. Hence the realization of predications such as (a).</p>
        <div class="example">Yo sikul ema Atieno. (Foc)<br>'It is in the direction of the school that Atieno has gone.'</div>
        <p>It, therefore, seems proper to regard yo as a content-word preposition whose general prepositional marker is realized only when the term in which it occurs has a PF function.</p>
        
        <h3>Expression of Pragmagtic Functions</h3>
        <p>Since the Theme and Tail of a predication are, in principle, outside the predication proper, their positioning is self-evident from a schema such as the one given in (sections discussing Theme & Tail).</p>
        <p>Given that the assignment of these two functions does not lead to any special marking on the surface realizations of a predication, we shall say no more about them here.</p>
        <p>The main concern of this section is with the PFs which are within the predication proper, namely, Topic and Focus.</p>
        <p>As we have seen in (3.2.1.4), Topic assignment as such does not have any morphological consequences. However, if a term whose SF is prepositionally marked is assigned the Topic function and, consequently, has to stand in the preverbal position, there will be a morphological effect on the verb form following the specifications of expression rule (I (BC).</p>
        <p>As we have already explained, the assignment of the PF of Focus has, as its morphological consequence, the introduction of [e (ma)], realized immediately after the term in question. This fact may be stated by expression rule (i).</p>
        <p>If a term Xl is assigned Focus function, then the term Xl is realized as ...Xl e(ma)..., e.g.:</p>
        <div class="example">Juma e ma ji dwaro. (Focus)<br>'It is Juma that the people want.'</div>
        <p>As in the case of Topic assignment, the morphological consequences of Focus assignment on the verb will be handled by our expression rule (iii on verbal predicate), e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">Juma e ma ji oriedo-ne (Foc)<br>'It is for Juma that the people have lined up</div>
        
        <h2>3.4 Review & Practice</h2>
        <h3>3.4.1 Summary of Predicate Frames & Expression Rules</h3>
        
        <h4>Predicate Frames</h4>
        <p>Introduction</p>
        <p>Predicate frames in Dholuo define the structural patterns that govern the relationship between verbs and their arguments (subjects, objects, complements). They determine:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of arguments a verb requires (one, two, or three).</li>
            <li>The syntactic and semantic roles of arguments (e.g., agent, patient).</li>
            <li>Possible modifications to the verb (tense, aspect, negation).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Classification of Predicate Frames</h4>
        <p>A. Intransitive Predicate Frames (One-argument structures)</p>
        <p>These verbs require only a subject and do not take an object.</p>
        <p>Structure: (NP) + V (e.g., Omondi owuok – "Omondi has left.")</p>
        <p>Types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unaccusative verbs (experiencer subject, e.g., tho "to die").</li>
            <li>Unergative verbs (agent subject, e.g., wuok "to leave").</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>B. Monotransitive Predicate Frames (Two-argument structures)</p>
        <p>Require a subject and a direct object.</p>
        <p>Structure: (NP) + V + (NP) (e.g., Omondi neno ot – "Omondi is seeing a house.").</p>
        <p>Typically describe actions affecting an object (neno "to see," kelo "to bring").</p>
        
        <p>C. Ditransitive Predicate Frames (Three-argument structures)</p>
        <p>Require a subject, an indirect object, and a direct object.</p>
        <p>Structure: (NP) + V + (NP) + (NP) (e.g., Omondi miyo nyar gi pesa – "Omondi is giving their girl money.").</p>
        <p>Common in verbs of transfer (miyo "to give," tang'o "to show").</p>
        
        <h4>Satellites in Predicate Frames</h4>
        <p>Satellites provide additional information about a sentence but do not define its core structure. They modify a predication by specifying:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Time (e.g., Achola kelo pi sani – "Achola is bringing water now.").</li>
            <li>Manner (e.g., Jathum miel mamit – "The musician is singing beautifully.").</li>
            <li>Location (e.g., Otieno dhi nam – "Otieno is going to the lake.").</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Syntax Functions</h4>
        <p>Functional Grammar (FG) traditionally recognizes only two syntactic functions: Subject (Subj) and Object (Obj). The Subj function refers to the entity from which the predication's perspective is determined, while the Obj serves as the secondary vantage point. This distinction is particularly relevant in active-passive transformations in languages like English.</p>
        <p>However, in Dholuo, Subj-Obj assignment proves inadequate for describing constituent order. Instead, Dholuo syntax is governed by semantic and pragmatic functions without reliance on syntactic roles.</p>
        <p>Dholuo follows an unmarked constituent order: 1 V 2 ... n, where V represents the verb, and 1, 2, … n denote term positions dictated by the verb's valency. Observations on Dholuo syntax reveal:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The alpha term (e.g., Otieno, Jatedo) always precedes the verb.</li>
            <li>The post-verbal position (2) is occupied by the highest-ranked non-alpha function (e.g., Goal, Recipient, Beneficiary).</li>
            <li>Lower-ranked terms follow hierarchical positioning unless pragmatic functions alter their placement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given that Subj-Obj assignment lacks descriptive relevance in Dholuo, syntactic functions (as used in FG) are deemed unnecessary. Instead, constituent order is best explained through semantic role hierarchies (e.g., Agent, Goal, Beneficiary) and pragmatic considerations.</p>
        
        <h4>Pragmatic Functions</h4>
        <p>Pragmatic functions (PFs) in FG serve to mark the informational structure of utterances. They are classified as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>External PFs: Theme (frames discourse relevance) and Tail (provides afterthoughts).</li>
            <li>Internal PFs: Topic (sets referential focus) and Focus (marks the most salient information).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Themes & Tails Functions</h4>
        <p>Theme: Introduces the discourse framework, limiting relevance to a specific referent:</p>
        <div class="example">Nyako ma biro no en osiepni? → That coming girl, is she your friend?</div>
        <div class="example">Joluo, gin gikia ohala. → The Luo, they do not know business matters.</div>
        <p>Tail: Appends additional information post-predication, often as an afterthought:</p>
        <div class="example">Ok adware, wiye duong' no. → I don't want him, that big-headed one.</div>
        <div class="example">Ohero koko, en. → He likes noise, him.</div>
        
        <h4>Topic Function</h4>
        <p>The Topic function in Functional Grammar assigns prominence to an entity about which a predication makes a statement. In Dholuo:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Topic is preverbal.</li>
            <li>Alpha terms always appear before the verb, so they do not gain prominence solely from being Topics.</li>
            <li>Any term (nuclear or satellite) can be assigned the Topic function under appropriate pragmatic conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <div class="example">Inego kwach → 'A leopard is being killed.' (General information)</div>
        <div class="example">Kwach inego → 'The leopard is being killed.' (Focus on 'kwach')</div>
        <p>Contextual Differences:</p>
        <div class="example">Q: Ango ma timore? ('What is happening?') → A: Inego kwach.</div>
        <div class="example">Q: Itimo kwach nade? ('What is happening to the leopard?') → A: Kwach inego.</div>
        <div class="example">Nyithindo nego kwach → 'Children are killing a leopard.'</div>
        <div class="example">Kwach nyithindo nego → 'The leopard is being killed by children.'</div>
        
        <h4>Focus Function</h4>
        <p>Focus identifies the most salient information in a sentence. There are six types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Completive Focus – Fills missing information.</li>
            <li>Selective Focus – Highlights one option among several.</li>
            <li>Replacing Focus – Corrects prior information.</li>
            <li>Expanding Focus – Adds to given information.</li>
            <li>Restricting Focus – Narrows a presupposed set.</li>
            <li>Parallel Focus – Contrasts two pieces of information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Dholuo Focus Markers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>e (primary marker)</li>
            <li>ma (used in relative clauses)</li>
            <li>e ma (combined for emphasis)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <div class="example">Otieno e wuoyi. → 'Otieno is the boy.' (Contrastive Focus)</div>
        <div class="example">Otieno wuoyi. → 'Otieno is a boy.' (General statement)</div>
        <div class="example">Otieno e ma nyalo konyowa. → 'Otieno is the one who can help us.'</div>
        <div class="example">Chunya e ma rach. → 'I am just in low spirits (nothing else is wrong).'</div>
        <div class="example">Ang'o ma nyathino dwaro kanyo? → 'What does the child want there?'</div>
        
        <h4>Expression Rules in Dholuo</h4>
        <p>These rules govern how grammatical structures are realized.</p>
        <p>Linguistic Features Covered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Case and adpositions.</li>
            <li>Predicate realization (voice, auxiliaries, agreement).</li>
            <li>Word order.</li>
            <li>Stress and intonation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Verbal Predicate Expression:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Passive Form if no agent is mentioned:<br>
                Oneg diel. → 'A goat has been killed.'</li>
            <li>Active Form if an alpha term (agent) is present:<br>
                Ng'ato nego diel. → 'Someone is killing a goat.'</li>
            <li>Preverbal Positioning affects verb morphology:<br>
                Wendo wanego-ne diel. → 'The guest we are slaughtering a goat for.'</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Semantic Functions & Prepositional Marking</h4>
        <p>Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG) relates semantic functions (SFs) to prepositional markers in surface structures. The rules governing this relationship are:</p>
        <p>Zero Prepositional Marking</p>
        <p>If the SF is Ø, PO, Fo, Proc, or Dir (with no content-word preposition), there is no prepositional marking.</p>
        <div class="example">Nyithindo dhi nam (Direction) → "The children are going to the lake."</div>
        
        <p>Possession Marking</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Singular possession: mar precedes the term.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">Pesa ni mar japidi → "This money belongs to the nurse."</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Plural possession: mag precedes the term.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">Pesa gi mag japidi → "This money belongs to the nurses."</div>
        
        <p>Companion/Instruction Marking</p>
        <p>gi is used before the term.</p>
        <div class="example">Nyathi wuotho gi min (Companion) → "The child is walking with its mother."</div>
        
        <p>Beneficiary & Recipient Marking</p>
        <p>ne precedes the term.</p>
        <div class="example">Ang'iewo buk ne nyathina (Beneficiary) → "I have bought a book for my child."</div>
        
        <p>Location, Source, or Direction Marking</p>
        <p>e precedes the term.</p>
        <div class="example">Aketo chiemo e wi mesa (Location) → "I've placed food on the table."</div>
        
        <p>Special Directional Marker (yo)</p>
        <p>Functions as a content-word preposition, disallowing other general prepositions.</p>
        <div class="example">Atieno odhi yo sikul → "Atieno has gone in the direction of the school."</div>
        <div class="example">Yo sikul ema Atieno (Focus) → "It is in the direction of the school that Atieno has gone."</div>
        
        <h4>Pragmatic Functions & Morphological Effects</h4>
        <p>Theme & Tail</p>
        <p>Positioned outside the predication proper. No special marking needed.</p>
        
        <p>Topic Assignment</p>
        <p>No morphological changes unless a prepositionally marked term moves to the preverbal position.</p>
        
        <p>Focus Assignment</p>
        <p>Morphologically marked by e (ma) immediately after the term.</p>
        <div class="example">Juma e ma ji dwaro (Focus) → "It is Juma that the people want."</div>
        <div class="example">Juma e ma ji oriedo-ne (Focus + verb modification)</div>
        <p>Semantic roles dictate prepositional markers: (e.g., mar for singular possession, gi for companionship).</p>
        <p>Focus function introduces e (ma): e.g., Juma e ma ji dwaro → "It is Juma that the people want."</p>
        <p>Directional preposition (yo) behaves uniquely: necessitates preverbal positioning with an added e suffix.</p>
    </div>
