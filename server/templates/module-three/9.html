        <h2>3.5 Expression Rules and Constituent Order</h2>
        
        <h3>3.5.1 Introduction</h3>
        
        <p>The treatment of constituent order in FG is summarized as follows:</p>
        
        <p>The predications underlying tinguistic expressions are regarded as constructions in which no linear order has been defined over the constituents.</p>
        
        <p>In order to arrive at the actual linear order of linguistic expressions, then, we need rules and principles which give a relative order topreviously unordered set of constituents. These rules and principles belong to the expression component of the grammar according to FG.</p>
        
        <p>The principles by means of which order is defined for linguistic expressions are based on the view that ordering patterns of each language are the result of different preferential tendencies which in part counteract each other in that they cannot all be complied with at the same time.</p>
        
        <p>These preferential tendencies are the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the preference for having constituents with the same ftžnctional specification invariably in the same structural position;</li>
            <li>the preference for assigning certain special positions to certain designated categories of constituents and to constituents characterized by pragmatic frnctions;</li>
            <li>the preference for having constituents ordered from left to right in order of increasing categorial complexity.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The first preference is accounted for by the assumption that all languages have one or more "functional patterns" which define a number of crucial positions for constituents of predications to go to.</p>
        
        <p>For Dholuo, the place of syntactic functions in the functional patterns is taken by semantic functions. Moreover, only one alpha term occurs in a predication and such a term automatically goes into the preverbal position A.</p>
        
        <p>One of the first three non-alpha terms (Goal, Recipient, Beneneficiary) usually occupies the immediately postverbal position.</p>
        
        <p>Our discussion up to this point gives us the following functional pattern for Dholuo:</p>
        <div class="example">
            Theme, P1 V Ø
        </div>
        
        <p>where Ø marks the first postverbal position without any suggestion that what occupies that position is an object.</p>
        
        <p>The positions of Theme and Tail are outside the predication proper and are not filled by constituents from the underlying predication.</p>
        
        <p>As far as the surface order of constituents goes, our primary concerns are the predicationinternal positions PI, A, V, Ø and the position of non-alpha constituents not occupying the immediately postverbal position Ø.</p>
        
        <p>As we have said above, if a predication has an Agent constituent, it will, being an alpha term, automatically occupy the preverbal position, even without havmg a pragmatic function. The postverbal position of a nuclear predication can be occupied by one of the following constituent combinations, depending on the of affairs designated by the verbal predicate in question (V shows the position of the Verb):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>V Go</li>
            <li>V Rec Go</li>
            <li>V Ben Go</li>
            <li>V Go Loc</li>
            <li>Vø</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The majority of the cases are of type (V Go), respresenting most of the transitive Action verbs. Types (V Rec Go) and (V Ben Go) are very few, representing the rare cases in which the Rec or Ben constituent is not marked by a preposition. Such cases can be observed in following sentences:</p>
        <div class="example">
            Ng'ato omiyo Atieno pesa mathoth<br>
            'Someone has given Atieno a lot of money.'
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            Jatedo otuono japidi chiemo (nurse(Ben) food(Go)<br>
            'The cook has denied the nurse food.'
        </div>
        
        <p>Type (V Go Loc) represents those cases in which a post-verbal locative constituent obligatorily occurs within the nuclear predication, coming after the Goal, as in the sentence:</p>
        <div class="example">
            Mama oketo kuon e mesa (ugali (Go) table (Loc)<br>
            Mother has put ugali on the table.'
        </div>
        
        <p>The last type (Vø) represents those cases in which the postverbal constituent has a zero semantic fumction, as characteristic of state predications, e.g.:</p>
        <div class="example">
            Ng'at cha paro chiege<br>
            That man is thinking of his wife.'
        </div>
        
        <p>We have pointed out earlier in this chapter that there seems to be some amount of freedom in the positioning of the non-alpha terms of Dholuo. Let us now reconsider this idea in the light of the conceptual framework that we have developed above.</p>
        
        <p>Of primary interest are the cases in which what are clearly X-constituents precede a binding nuclear constituent in a given predication. For an example, let us consider the following predication:</p>
        <div class="example">
            Ng'ato tedo rech (fish (Go)<br>
            'Someone is cooking fish.'
        </div>
        
        <p>which, being a nuclear predication, shows that the Goal term (rech) is the binding constituent. This predication can be extended by an X-constituent with the SF of Beneficiary to give us:</p>
        <div class="example">
            Ng'ato tedo rech newelo (visitors (Ben)<br>
            Someone is cooking fish for the visitors.'
        </div>
        
        <p>Now, so long as the X-constituent comes after the binding constituent, as it docs in (a-above), the position stated above remains uncontradicted.</p>
    </div>
