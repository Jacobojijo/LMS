        <h2>3.2.3 Expression of Semantic & Pragmatic Functions</h2>
        <h3>Expression of Semantic Functions</h3>
        <p>The following expression rules are required to relate SFS (Systemic Functional Grammar) to their corresponding prepositional markers in the surface structure.</p>
        <p>If the SF of a term is Ã˜, PO, Fo, Proc, or Dir (where there is no content-word preposition), then there is zero prepositional marking for the term, e.g.:</p>
        <div class="example">Nyithindo dhi nam (Direction)<br>'The children are gomg to the lake.'</div>
        <p>If the SF of a term is Poss, and the possessed element is singular, then the term is immediately preceded by mar, e.g.:</p>
        <div class="example">Pesa ni mar japidi(Possesion)<br>'This money (sg.) belongs to the nurse.'</div>
        <p>If the SF of a term is Poss, and the possessed element is plural, then the term is immediately preceded by mag, e.g.:</p>
        <div class="example">Pesa gi mag japidi (Possesion)<br>This money (pl.) belongs to the nurse.'</div>
        <p>If the SF of a term is Companion or Instruction, then the term is immediately preceded by (gi), e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">Nyathi wuotho gi min (Companion)<br>The child is walking with its mother.'</div>
        <p>If the SF of a term is Ben or Rec, then the term is immediately preceded by ne, e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">Ang'iewo buk ne nyathina. (Ben)<br>I have bought a book for my child.'</div>
        <p>If the SF of a term is Loc, So, or Dirirection (Where there is a content-word preposition), then the term is immediately preceded by [e], e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">Aketo chiemo e wi mesa (Loc)<br>'I've placed food on the table.'</div>
        <p>One preposition whose realization has not been dealt with here is the non-target Direction marker [yo]. This preposition is better treated as a content-word preposition though it has the properties of both a specific and a general preposition. Like the latter, it does not allow any other general preposition to accompany it. Thus, only predications like (a) are well formed, and not those like (b).</p>
        <div class="example">Adeno odhi yo sikul<br>'Atieno has gone in the direction of the school.'</div>
        <div class="example">*Afieno odhi e yo sikul</div>
        <p>But, like content-word prepositions, it goes to the preverbal position with its term, normally necessitating the suffixing of the general preposition e to the verbal predicate. Hence the realization of predications such as (a).</p>
        <div class="example">Yo sikul ema Atieno. (Foc)<br>'It is in the direction of the school that Atieno has gone.'</div>
        <p>It, therefore, seems proper to regard yo as a content-word preposition whose general prepositional marker is realized only when the term in which it occurs has a PF function.</p>
        
        <h3>Expression of Pragmagtic Functions</h3>
        <p>Since the Theme and Tail of a predication are, in principle, outside the predication proper, their positioning is self-evident from a schema such as the one given in (sections discussing Theme & Tail).</p>
        <p>Given that the assignment of these two functions does not lead to any special marking on the surface realizations of a predication, we shall say no more about them here.</p>
        <p>The main concern of this section is with the PFs which are within the predication proper, namely, Topic and Focus.</p>
        <p>As we have seen in (3.2.1.4), Topic assignment as such does not have any morphological consequences. However, if a term whose SF is prepositionally marked is assigned the Topic function and, consequently, has to stand in the preverbal position, there will be a morphological effect on the verb form following the specifications of expression rule (I (BC).</p>
        <p>As we have already explained, the assignment of the PF of Focus has, as its morphological consequence, the introduction of [e (ma)], realized immediately after the term in question. This fact may be stated by expression rule (i).</p>
        <p>If a term Xl is assigned Focus function, then the term Xl is realized as ...Xl e(ma)..., e.g.:</p>
        <div class="example">Juma e ma ji dwaro. (Focus)<br>'It is Juma that the people want.'</div>
        <p>As in the case of Topic assignment, the morphological consequences of Focus assignment on the verb will be handled by our expression rule (iii on verbal predicate), e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">Juma e ma ji oriedo-ne (Foc)<br>'It is for Juma that the people have lined up</div>
        <p>Directional preposition (yo) behaves uniquely: necessitates preverbal positioning with an added e suffix.</p>
    </div>
