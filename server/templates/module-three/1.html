        <h2>3. Predicate Frames, Expression Rules and Complex Sentences</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Predicate Frames</h3>
        <h3>3.1.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>In advanced Dholuo grammar, predicate frames refer to the structural patterns that define the relationship between a verb (predicate) and its associated arguments (such as subjects, objects, and complements). Predicate frames are central to understanding Dholuo syntax, as they determine the permissible structures within a sentence, the number of arguments a verb can take, and the syntactic roles these arguments play.</p>
        
        <h4>1. Understanding Predicate Frames</h4>
        <p>Predicate frames serve as blueprints for sentence construction. They specify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of arguments a verb requires (one, two, or more).</li>
            <li>The syntactic role of each argument (subject, object, indirect object, etc.).</li>
            <li>The semantic roles assigned to arguments (agent, patient, experiencer, etc.).</li>
            <li>The possible modifications that can be applied to the verb structure (such as aspect, tense, or negation).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Predicate frames in Dholuo differ significantly depending on whether a verb is intransitive, transitive, or ditransitive.</p>
        
        <h4>2. Classification of Predicate Frames in Dholuo</h4>
        <p><strong>A. Intransitive Predicate Frames (One-argument structures)</strong></p>
        <p>Intransitive verbs have a single argument, typically the subject, and do not require an object. The structure follows:</p>
        <p>(NP) + V<br>(Noun Phrase + Verb)</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <div class="example">Omondi owuok. → "Omondi has left."<br>wuok ('to leave') takes only one argument (Omondi as the subject).</div>
        <div class="example">Nyar gi nindo. → "Their girl is sleeping."<br>nindo ('to sleep') requires only the subject (Nyar gi).</div>
        <p>Intransitive verbs can also be classified based on semantic roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unaccusative verbs: The subject is not an agent but an experiencer (e.g., tho "to die").</li>
            <li>Unergative verbs: The subject performs an action (e.g., wuok "to leave").</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>B. Monotransitive Predicate Frames (Two-argument structures)</strong></p>
        <p>Monotransitive verbs require two arguments: a subject and a direct object. The structure follows:</p>
        <p>(NP) + V + (NP)<br>(Subject + Verb + Object)</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <div class="example">Omondi neno ot. → "Omondi is seeing a house."<br>neno ('to see') takes the subject (Omondi) and the object (ot).</div>
        <div class="example">Juma kelo pesa. → "Juma is bringing money."<br>kelo ('to bring') requires both a subject (Juma) and an object (pesa).</div>
        <p>These verbs typically describe an action performed by an agent affecting a patient or theme.</p>
        
        <p><strong>C. Ditransitive Predicate Frames (Three-argument structures)</strong></p>
        <p>Ditransitive verbs take three arguments: a subject, a direct object, and an indirect object. The structure follows:</p>
        <p>(NP) + V + (NP) + (NP)<br>(Subject + Verb + Indirect Object + Direct Object)</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <div class="example">Omondi miyo nyar gi pesa. → "Omondi is giving their girl money."<br>miyo ('to give') requires a subject (Omondi), an indirect object (nyar gi), and a direct object (pesa).</div>
        <div class="example">Juma tang'o ne nyathi buk. → "Juma is showing the child a book."<br>tang'o ('to show') governs three arguments (Juma, nyathi, buk).</div>
        <p>Ditransitive verbs often involve actions of transfer, such as giving, telling, or showing.</p>
        
        <h4>Satellites</h4>
        <p>Satellites are constituents which do not function in the definition of the state of as such, but give information pertaining to the state of affairs as a whole, by specifiying the time or the location of the state of affairs, giving the reason or cause of its obtaining, and providing other addiüonal information.</p>
        <p>In terms of internal structure, satellites are just like nuclear arguments, and they perform the same kind of semantic functions. Let us take the predication (a) and its underlying representation.</p>
        <div class="example">Achola kelo pi<br>'Achola is bringing (some) water.'</div>
        <p>This is an action predication in which (Achola) is the Xi term with the SF (Sentence Fragment) of Agent, and [pi] is the X2 term with the SF of Goal. The underlying predication is a nuclear predication because it contains only enough arguments to fill the argument positions of the nuclear predicate frame for the verbal predicate kelo. We can, if we find it necessary, extend the nuclear predication by adding a satellite with SF of Temp (Time): which is the underlying representation of</p>
        <div class="example">Achola kelo pi sani<br>'Achola (is)bringing water now.'</div>
        <p>The following extended predications (and their corresponding underlying representations) illustrate other types of satellite terms (italicized) in Dholuo.</p>
        <div class="example">Jathum miel mamit<br>'The musician is beautifrlly.'</div>
        <div class="example">Otieno dhi nam<br>'Otieno is going to the lake.'</div>
        <p>In the above examples, we have simplified the underlying representations to show only the relevant properties of the predications. These examples hardly exhaust the full range of possibilities, though they adequately illustrate the idea of an extended predication and, thus, the role of satellite terms.</p>
        <p>In principle, all the various types of adverbial expressions discussed in module 02 can be used as satellites to extend nuclear Iredications, so long as we pay due attention to the restrictions imposed on our range of possibilities by the various states of affairs.</p>
