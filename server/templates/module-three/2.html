        <h2>3.1.2 Syntax Functions</h2>
        
        <p>The standard Functional Grammar theory works with only two syntactic functions, namely Subj(ect) and Obj(ect). Subj function can be explained in these words:</p>
        <blockquote>a constituent with Subj function refers to the entity which is uken as a point of departure for detennining the perspective from which the state of affairs designated by the predication is presented.</blockquote>
        
        <p>Accordingly, we assign Obj function to the entity which is taken as the second point of departure (or vantage point).</p>
        
        <p>The real motivation for the inclusion of Subj and Obj functions in FG is the need to account for active-passive paraphrase relations, especially in the case of languages such as English in which a Constituent with Obj function in an active sentence assumes Subj finction in the corresponding passive construction. For example, in the sentences:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Men rule the world.<br>
            Subj&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obj
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            The world is ruled by men<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Subj
        </div>
        
        <p>I have demonstrated that the concept of Subj assignment, as used in FG, has no descriptive value in Dholuo. As we shall see in this study, an adequate account of constituent order in Dholuo can be arrived at by using only semantic and pragmatic ftnctions. To do this we need to:</p>
        
        <p>â€¦ semantic functions into at least two major subclasses according to how they relate to Agent on the SFH. Semantic functions which, like Agent, typically belong to the Xl term in a given predication have a paradigmatic relationship to Agent and must, therefore, occupy the same hierarchical position (HI) as Agent. Semantic functions such as Goal, which do not belong to the Xl are necessarily in a syntagmatic relationship to Agent; and must find their positions on the SFH in some place (Hi), such that 1 precede</p>
        
        <p>Those semantic functions which occupy the (Hi) position are referred to, after the work quoted above, as 'alpha' functions while the others are said to be 'non-alpha'.</p>
        
        <p>Similarly, terms are called alpha or non-alpha, depending on the SFS they have in a given predication. The unmarked constituent order for complete predications in Dholuo is as follows:6</p>
        
        <p>1 V 2 ... n where V is the verbal predicate which forms the strucnral nucleus of the predication; and 1, 2 ... n are term positions.</p>
        
        <p>Among the term positions, only 1 must in all cases be occupied since the filling of the rest (Of the positions) (2 n) will, in each case, depend on the valency of the verbal predicate in question. This is the kind of constituent order reflected in the following sentences:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Otieno nindo<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v<br>
            'Otieno is sleeping.'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Otieno ochamo rech<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br>
            'Otieno has eaten fish.'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Otieno miyo paka Chak<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br>
            'Otieno is giving the cat some milk.'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Otieno ong'iewo nanga ne nyathine<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br>
            'Otieno has bought a dress for his child.'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Otieno ong'iewo ne nyathine nanga<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br>
            'Otieno has bought his child a dress.'
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Jatedo miyo nyathi nyuka nejapidi e jikon<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br>
            'The cook is giving the child some gruel for the maid in the kitchen.'
        </div>
        
        <p>The followmg general tendencies are observed in sentences of this kind:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>In every complete predication, the alpha term (e.g. Otieno and Jatedo) occupies the preverbal position 1.</li>
            <li>The immediately postverbal position 2 is occupied by the next term on the SFH which occurs in the given predication, subject to observation (111).</li>
            <li>(Except in the case of some few verbal predicates, e.g. miyo 'to give', which have their peculiar restrictions on the positioning of non-alpha terms, position 2 can be occupied by a term bearing any of the first three non-alpha ftnctions, namely, Go, Rec, and Ben.</li>
            <li>(No term bearing a semantic function lower than Ben on the SFH can occupy position 2 if a term bearing any of the first three non-alpha functions Go, Reg, or Ben occurs in the same predication.</li>
            <li>Unless they are assigned some special (pragmatic) functions, terms bearing semantic functions lower than Ben on the SFH are normally positioned according to their hierarchical order.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Since we have taken the position that there is no need for Subj assignment in the description of Dholuo, we must accordingly also dispense with the notion of Obj assignment because in FG the latter presupposes the former. In general, then, the notion of 'syntactic function' (as applied in FG) is irrelevant to the description of Dholuo.</p>
        
        <p>In both preverbal and post-verbal positions, constituent order in Dholuo will be accounted for in statements which make reference to semantic functions.</p>
