        <h2>3.2 Expression Rules</h2>
        
        <h3>3.2.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>The linguistic features accounted for by the expression rules in FG are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the form in which the terms are realized, in particular by cases and/or adpositions;</li>
            <li>the form in which the predicate is realized, in particular the voice, auxiliary elements and agreement phenomena;</li>
            <li>the order of elements;</li>
            <li>stress and intonation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>3.2.2 Expression of Verbal Predicate</h3>
        <p>Generally, Dholuo does not have a complex verbal morphology. However, the following expression rules need to be included in an FG account of Dholuo, considering the consequences of the semantic and pragmatic functions which various terms have on the surface forms of the verbs.</p>
        
        <p>Since no generally agreed-upon formalism exists for such rules, we shall state them in words.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>If there is an incomplete predication in the Xl term, then a passive verb form is used, e.g.:</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="example">a) oneg diel
          'A goat has been killed.'</div>
          
        <ol start="2">
            <li>If there is an alpha term in a predication, then an active verb form is used, e.g.:</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="example">b) Ng'ato nego diel
             Someone is killing a goat.'</div>
             
        <ol start="3">
            <li>If a term is to be realized in the preverbal position as a result of having a pragmatic frnction, then the verbal predicate (of the predication) bears, as an affix, the prepositional SF marker of the term in question, e.g.:</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="example">c) Wendo wanego-ne diel.
           The guest we are slaughtering a goat for (him).'</div>
           
        <p>To avoid problems that would arise from the general statement of (c), certain SFS, e.g. Goal, should be specified as having zero prepositional marking.</p>
        
        <p>The devices that may be employed to indicate which SF is marked by what preposition are many. Such devices may also be incorporated in the expression-rules component. Our next section deals with such rules.</p>
