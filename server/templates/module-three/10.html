        <h1>3.6 Word Fronting</h1>
        <h2>3.6.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>The constituent-order phenomenon under discussion here involves the placement of question words seeking the identity of non-alpha terms in preverbal position.</p>
        <p>Paraphrase relations arising from this phenomenon are found in languages such as Dholuo in which the question-word cm occur before or after the verb. Such paraphrases are exemplified by the a- and b-parts of (a-b) and (c-d) below:</p>
        <div class="example">Nyathi dwaro ang'o? 
            'What does the child want?</div>
        <div class="example">Ang'o ma nyathi dwaro?</div>
        <div class="example">Ji tho kamano kanye?
           'Where do people die like that?'</div> 
        <div class="example">Kanye ma ji tho-e kamano?</div>
        <p>It is worth noting, if constrast may shed some light, that predications in which the informational gap happens to be in an alpha term, e.g. (e) below, do not have paraphrases of the type found in the aconstructions above.</p>
        <div class="example">Ng'a ma dwaro ruoth? Who wants the chief?</div>
        <p>In transformational accounts the kind of data given in (a-b) and (c-d) can be taken care of by using an optional Q-fronting rule which applies to deep structures akin to the of construction to produce phrase-markers for the b-types.</p>
        <p>The fact that b-type constructions have the Focus-marking element [ma] tends to lure one into using the assignment of the pragrnatic function of Focus to account for the difference between the a- and b-type constructions.</p> 
        <p>What is puzzling, however, is that even (e), which has the question-word in its unmarked position, has an obligatory Focus-marking element.</p>
        <p>We, therefore, need to investigate the underlying source of preverbal question-words in Dholuo a little further. Our main concern here is with the Focus-marked ones, since they are more problematic than others. To gain some insight into this problem, let us begin by re-examining the theoretical status of Focus constructions in general.</p>
        <p>In the standard FG theory, as we have observed in chapter 3, Focus constructions are regarded as consequences of the assiglment of the PF (pragmatic fixnction) Focus to a given term of an underlying predication.</p> 
        <p>An analysis can be applied to interrogative Focus constructions, we arrive at the following 'distribution of interrogative constructions across languages', to use his own phraseology:</p> 
        <div class="example">Only straight interrogatives;</div>
        <div class="example">Only questioned Focus constructions;</div>
        <div class="example">Straight and Focus interrogatives in free variation;</div>
        <div class="example">Straight and Focus interrogatives in (partial) complementary</div>
        <p>It can be demonstrated that Dholuo has something of (i), (ii), and (iv) as given in this typology.</p>
        <p>Type (i) interrogatives are mainly those with the confirmation-seeking Q-words [bende, donge, koso], and the information-seeking Q-word [ere], as in</p>
        <div class="example">Bende oyud jakuo?
           'Has the thief been found?'</div>
        <div class="example">Donge oyud jakuo?
           'Hasn't the thief been found?'</div>
        <div class="example">Koso ng'ato onge?	 
          'Might it be that someone is absent (i.e. Am I right to assume that   everyone is present)?</div>  
        <div class="example">Ere wuon ot?
            'Where is the owner of the house?</div> 
        <p>These, whatever variation they may allow in the positioning of the Q-word, are always "straight interrogatives".</p>  
        <p>Type (ii) consists of interrogatives containing an information-seeking Q-word which seeks the identity of an alpha term, as in:</p>
        <div class="example">Ng'a ma chamo punda?
            Who eats a donkey?'</div>
        <div class="example">Punda ng'a ma chamo? (=a)</div>
        <div class="example">Ang'o ma oyiecho lawe?
            'What has torn his garment?'</div>
        <div class="example">Lawe ang'o ma oyiecho? (=a)</div>
        <p>It should be noted that even when [a-] term is non-alpha placed in the special position (Pi) by Topic assignment, the Focus element m the construction remains unaffected, as demonstrated by the fact that [ma] is realized after the Q-word in both the a- and b-sentences.</p>
        <p>Type (iv) consists of interrogatives contaming a non-alpha term in either the preverbal position (in which case we have a Focus interrogative) or in the post-verbal position '(in which case we have a straight interrogative), as can be observed by comparing the a- and b-sentences below:</p> 
        <div class="example">Jakuo okawo ang'o?
           What has the thief taken?</div>
        <div class="example">Ang'o ma jakuo okawo? 
           'What is it that the thief has taken?'</div> 
        <div class="example">Sibuor ochamo ng'a?
           'Whom has the lion eaten?'</div>	
        <div class="example">Ng'a ma sibuor ochamo?
'Whom is it that the lion has eaten?'</div>
        <p>For further insight into the nature of our problem, let us look again at the nature of declarative Focus constructions. Consider the following pairs of constructions:</p>
        <div class="example">Juma kelo kong'o.
           'Juma is bringing beer.'</div>
        <div class="example">Juma ema kelo kong'o
           'It is Juma who is bringing beer.'</div>
        <div class="example">Kwach omako diel 
          'A leopard has captured a goat.'</div>
        <div class="example">Kwach e ma omako diel
           'It is a leopard that has captured a goat.'</div>
        <p>In constructions of this type, it is fairly clear that the pragmatic circumstances leading to the utterance of the a-type constructions are different from those that lead to the utterance of the ones. Thus, (Juma kelo kong'o.) can answer, among others, the question:</p>
        <div class="example">Juma timo ang'o? 
            'What is Juma doing?'</div> <p>but it cannot normally answer the question:</p>
        <div class="example">Ng'a ma kelo kong'o?
            'Who is (it that is) bringing beer?'</div>
        <p>for which, given the right communicative setting, (Juma) could also be an appropriate response.</p>
        <p>It is questions such as (Ng'a ma kelo kong'o?) that are answered by constructions of the type represented by (Juma ema kelo kong'o), if an elliptical form (e.g. (Juma)) is not used.</p>
        <p>Focus constructions have special underlying predications, different from those of non-Focus predications in the crucial fact that the former start with a Focus marking from the very beginning (of their derivation), since this Focus element is part of the general schema underlying the predications in question.</p> 
        <p>Now, the relationship between corresponding straight and Focus interrogatives in type (iv) above is that while they involve different for solving the same problem, their equivalence 'can be established via the presuppositions connected with them'.</p>
        <p>Thus, both (Jakuo okawo ang'o?) and (Ang'o ma jakuo okawo?) presuppose the propositional content of (a-below).</p>
        <div class="example">Jakuo okawo gimoro.
           'The thief has taken something '</div>
        <p>In this case, each of the questions (Jakuo okawo ang'o?) and (Ang'o ma jakuo okawo?) is aimed at what the thief has taken. But they employ different strategies, (Jakuo okawo ang'o?) using a non-Focus construction to ask the question while (Ang'o ma jakuo okawo?) uses a Focus construction to do the same thing.</p>
