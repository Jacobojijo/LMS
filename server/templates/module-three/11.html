        <h1>3.7 Positioning of Time Adverb</h1>
        <h2>3.7.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>The distributional behaviour of Dholuo Time-Adverbs (TAs) provides one of the best examples of the operation known as permutation in transformational grammar. This behaviour is well illustrated by the positioning of the TA [kawuono] in the sentences of (51) which, logically speaking, are paraphrases.</p>
        <div class="example">1. <i>Otieno nyalo loso kom ne min kawuono.</i>
             'Otieno can make a chair for his mother today.</div>
        <div class="example">1. <i>Otieno nyalo loso kom kawuono ne min.</i></div>
        <div class="example">2. <i>Otieno kawuono nyalo loso kom ne min.</i></div>
        <div class="example">3. <i>Kawuono Otieno nyalo loso kom ne min.</i></div>
        <p>Of the various forms of (a-d), (b) is the most marked, but not completely ill-formed. The variations of the examples above which are completely ill-formed are:</p>  
        <div class="example">1. *<i>Otieno nyalo loso kawuono kom ne min.</i>*</div>
        <div class="example">2. *<i>Otieno nyalo kawuono loso kom ne min.</i>*</div>
        <p>Of these two, (f) does not relate to the term positions of the verb [Ioso]. Since [nyalo] is a modal auxiliary, [nyalo loso] is a unit constituent in the functional pattern of Dholuo. This leaves the ill-formedness of (e) as the only case involving the distributional relationship between the term constituents.</p>
        <p>That the TA is at least tolerated in moreorless all positions except between the verbal predicate and the binding constituent, i.e. in the O position in the sequence ...V O Ob..., is illustrated by (52), in all of whose variations only (e) is definitely ill-formed.</p>
        <div class="example">1. <i>Otieno Ioso kom ne min gi spana e skul kawuono.</i>
            'Otieno is making a chair with a spanner for his mother at school today.</div> 
        <div class="example">1. <i>Otieno loso kom ne min gi spana kawuono e skul</i></div>
        <div class="example">2. <i>Otieno loso kom ne min kawuono gi spana e skul</i></div>
        <div class="example">3. <i>Otieno Iosc kom kawuono ne min gi spana e skul</i></div>
        <div class="example">4. *<i>Otieno Ioso kawuono kom ne min gi spana e skul</i>*</div>
        <div class="example">5. <i>Otieno kawuono loso kom ne min gi spana e skul</i></div>
        <div class="example">6. <i>Kawuono Otieno loso kom ne min gi spana e skul</i></div>
        <p>Let us point out that predications such as (a-g above), which we need for testing constituent positions, are rare and, therefore, tend to feel forced, since we do not, in natural communicative settings, usually find the need to string so many terms in one predication.</p> 
        <p>No doubt the well-formed constructions of (a-g above) have relative degrees of markedness. Of the six well-formed constructions, half ((a), (e), (g)) have a higher degree of acceptability than the other half (b), (c), (d).</p>
        <p>We account for the high acceptability of (a) by the fact that all the term constituents are in their expected order. That of (g) is accounted for by the fact that the TA is in PI position, clearly as the Topic element since there is no Focus marking.</p>
        <p>The claim that the TA occupies PI position as a result of Top assignment can be tested only by creating a pertinent pragmatic setting.</p> 
        <p>Let us consider question (a-b) below and its response (c).</p>
        <div class="example">1. <i>Nyoro Otieno notimo ang'o?</i>
           'What did Otieno do yesterday?</div>
        <div class="example">1. <i>Nyo-olwoko lepe</i>
           'He washed his clothes.'</div>
        <p>If the response (c) is followed by the question:</p>
        <div class="example">1. <i>To kawuono?</i>
          And today?</div>
        <p>Of the six well-formed realizations of (a-e above), (g) is the most appropriate response to (c-we have just looked at). This is just as it should be since (c) makes the TA kawuono the Top ofthe predication made in response to it.</p>
        <p>The status of the TA in (e) is perhaps the most controversial in the whole set of possibilities. While, as we have pointed out above, it is definitely acceptable, there is the problem of whether or not it can be said to have a structural commitment in this position. The possibilities are as follows: (i) its position is an alternative PI position and, therefore, it is a variant of (g), (ii) it occupies this position as a free element without any structural commitment, and (iii) it occupies this position as a result of nuclearization.</p>
