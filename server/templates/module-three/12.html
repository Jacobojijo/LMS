        <h3>3.8 Cleft Constructions</h3>

        <h4>3.8.1 Introduction</h4>

        <p>The sentences in (a, b) below represent what are referred to as cleft constructions.</p>

        <div class="example">Rech ema nyathi dwaro</div>
        <div class="example">'It is fish that the child wants.'</div>

        <div class="example">Gi ma nyathi dwaro en rech</div>

        <div class="example">Gi ma japuonj ni timo en (mana) chwado nyithindo</div>
        <div class="example">'What this teacher does is beat children.'</div>

        <div class="example">Japuonj no ema jodongo ohero</div>
        <div class="example">'It is that teacher whom the elders like.'</div>

        <p>The notion of a cleft-construction is based on the apparent relationship between constructions such as the ones given above and those in (57) below.</p>

        <div class="example">Nyathi dwaro rech</div>
        <div class="example">'(The) child want(s) fish.'</div>

        <div class="example">Japuonj ni chwado nyithindo</div>
        <div class="example">'This teacher beats(s) children.'</div>

        <div class="example">Jodongo obero japuonj no</div>
        <div class="example">'(The) elders like that teacher.'</div>

        <p>Relating (a-d) to (e-g), we can say that (e) is the non-cleft form of (a) and (b); (f) is the non-cleft form of (c); and (g) is the non-cleft form of (d).</p>

        <p>The cleft-constructions themselves fall into two categories, namely, cleft-constructions proper (a) and (d)) and pseudo-cleft constructions (b) and (c)). To the extent that both of them are believed to 'split up' what is a unified phrase in a corresponding non-cleft constructions they are both cleft-constructions.</p>

        <p>The differenceis that in the pseudo-cleft ones the verb still has what, in traditional terms, can be called its object. In either case, the non-cleft variety is considered to be the marked form. That is why transformational accounts of pseudo-cleft constructions work with deep structures corresponding more closely to the non-cleft constructions.</p>

        <p>From their surface forms, there is no doubt that cleft-constructions are Focus constructions. The pseudo-cleft ones involve only the insertion of some lexical forms in certain positions; and this can easily be handled by expression rules and the procedure for building predications from predicate frames.</p>

        <p>The same can be said of cleft-constructions in which an alpha term has a Focus function and is, therefore, placed in its right position according to the fimctional patterns of a language and a Focus marker (e (ma)) postposed to it by expression rules.</p>

        <p>This will take care of those cleftconstructions which would not require a movement rule even in a transformational account. Here, such cases include (b) and (c).</p>

        <p>Thus, the only kind of cleft-construction that would require a movement rule in a TG account is the cleft-construction proper, in our case, (a) and (d), in which non-alpha terms [rech] and [japuonjno], respectively, stand in the preverbal position.</p>

        <p>In the approach adopted here, (a) and (d) do not present any problem so long as we think of them as normal Focus constructions in which the Focus constituents are non-alpha terms.</p>
