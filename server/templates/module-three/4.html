        <h3>3.2.1.4 Topic</h3>
        <p>According to the standard Functional Grammar theory, the Topic function has the following three characteristics:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>it is assigned to the constituent designating 'the about which the predication predicates something in the given setting'.</li>
            <li>such an entity is usually 'coreferential to a constituent in a preceding question (or in a question that could have preceded)'</li>
            <li>'any term of a predication, regardless of its semantic and syntactic function may for Topic function, given the appropriate pragmatic conditions'.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The special position for Topic constituents in Dholuo is the preverbal position. Since alpha terms must stand before the verb if they occur in a predication, they do not gain any prominence by having the Topic function. Let us take the following predication:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Inego kwach 
            'A leopard is being killed,'</div>
            
        <p>In such a predication, the non-alpha term [kwach] can, if assigned the Topic function, stand before the verb as in:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Kwach inego</div>
        
        <p>Although (a) and (b) have the same meaning to th√© extent that they bear the same truth conditions, they perform different communicative functions. The former provides information as to what is taking place (in general, at a given time and place), but the latter gives information on what is happening to [kwach] in particular. Thus, for instance, to the question:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Ango ma timore
            'What is happening here?</div>
            
        <p>The predication expressed by (a) constitutes an appropriate answer, while its counterpart (b) does not. The latter would be an appropriate response to the question:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Itimo kwach nade?
          'What is being done to the leopard?'</div>
          
        <p>where it may, if communicatively found appropriate, be replaced by the non-alpha pronoun [-e], as in:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Ineg-e
          'It is being killed.'</div>
          
        <p>Again, it should be noted that (e) cannot replace (a) as a response to (c). Now take the predication:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Nyithindo nego kwach 
          'Children are killing a leopard.'</div>
          
        <p>Given a situation in which [kwach] is the Topic element, we would have the predication:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Kwach nyithindo nego</div>
        
        <p>in which kwach precedes the alpha term nyitbindo, which has to stand in preverbal position so long as it occurs in a given predication. This gives us the general pattern:</p>
        
        <div class="example">1. Topic Alpha Verb X</div>
        
        <p>(where X represents any constituent whose positloning is not accounted for by the procedures under discussion in this section).</p>
        
        <p>In general, given any underlying predication, we can assign the pragmatic function of Topic to one of its terms, nuclear or satellite.</p>
