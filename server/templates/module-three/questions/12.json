          "To replace the subject with an object"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Cleft-constructions in Dholuo serve to focus attention on a particular element in the sentence, making it more prominent in discourse."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "'Japuonj no ema jodongo ohero' is a cleft-construction proper because it explicitly places focus on the subject through syntactic restructuring."

      {
        "question": "What is the key difference between a cleft-construction and a non-cleft construction?",
        "options": [
          "Cleft-constructions separate a unified phrase to emphasize a particular element",
          "Non-cleft constructions require additional markers for focus",
          "Cleft-constructions eliminate the need for a subject",
          "Non-cleft constructions do not allow verbs"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Cleft-constructions are used to separate elements in a sentence, allowing specific emphasis on a chosen part, unlike non-cleft constructions."

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "'Gi ma nyathi dwaro en rech' is a pseudo-cleft construction because it focuses on a constituent using a relative clause, without requiring transformation rules."

      {
        "question": "In cleft-constructions proper, which part of the sentence usually appears in the preverbal position?",
        "options": [
          "The verb",
          "A non-alpha term",
          "A conjunction",
          "The subject pronoun"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "A cleft-construction proper typically places a non-alpha (non-subject or object) term in the preverbal position to highlight it."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which of the following is a correct transformation of the non-cleft sentence 'Nyathi dwaro rech' into a cleft-construction proper?",
        "options": [

      },
      {
        "question": "Why do pseudo-cleft constructions not require a movement rule in a transformational grammar (TG) account?",
        "options": [
          "Because they are already in their most natural syntactic order",
          "Because they do not involve focus constructions",
          "Because they only require the insertion of lexical elements",
          "Because they change the tense of the verb"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Pseudo-cleft constructions do not need movement rules in TG because they only require lexical insertion without syntactic reordering."

      {
        "question": "Which of the following sentences is a non-cleft construction?",
        "options": [
          "Rech ema nyathi dwaro",

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "'Jodongo obero japuonj no' is a non-cleft construction because it follows the standard subject-verb-object order without focus restructuring."

      {
        "question": "What distinguishes cleft-constructions proper from pseudo-cleft constructions?",
        "options": [
          "Cleft-constructions proper require movement of non-alpha terms",
          "Pseudo-cleft constructions require verb inversion",
          "Cleft-constructions proper always follow a subject-verb-object order",
          "Pseudo-cleft constructions are only used in past tense"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Cleft-constructions proper involve syntactic movement of a focused element, unlike pseudo-cleft constructions which maintain normal word order."

      {
        "question": "Which of the following best explains why cleft-constructions are considered focus constructions?",
        "options": [
          "They emphasize a specific part of the sentence",
          "They eliminate the need for objects",
          "They are always used with past tense verbs",
          "They require multiple subject markers"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Cleft-constructions highlight a specific part of the sentence, making it the focal point, which is why they are categorized as focus constructions."
