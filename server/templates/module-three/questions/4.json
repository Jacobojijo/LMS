        "question": "According to Functional Grammar theory, which of the following best describes the Topic function?",
        "options": [
          "The constituent that introduces new entities into discourse",
          "The constituent that carries the primary stress in a sentence",
          "The constituent about which the predication provides information in a given setting",
          "The constituent that always appears at the end of a sentence"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "The Topic identifies what the predication is about in the discourse context."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which of the following is NOT one of the three characteristics of the Topic function in Functional Grammar?",
        "options": [
          "It designates the entity about which something is predicated",
          "It must always be a noun phrase in sentence-initial position",
          "It is often coreferential with a constituent in a preceding or implied question",
          "Any term in a predication can function as a Topic given the right pragmatic conditions"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "While Topics often occur early, they are not strictly limited to sentence-initial noun phrases."

      {
        "question": "In Dholuo, where is the special position for Topic constituents?",
        "options": [
          "Postverbal position",
          "Preverbal position",
          "Final position in the clause",
          "Anywhere in the sentence"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Dholuo assigns Topic elements to the preverbal position for emphasis or focus."

        "question": "Which of the following statements best differentiates the communicative functions of the sentences \"Inego kwach\" and \"Kwach inego\"?",
        "options": [
          "The first states what is happening, while the second emphasizes what is happening to the leopard",
          "The first expresses doubt, while the second expresses certainty",
          "The first is used in informal speech, while the second is used in formal contexts",
          "The first is grammatically incorrect, while the second is the only valid structure"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Word order reflects focus: 'Kwach inego' places emphasis on the object (leopard)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is \"Kwach inego\" NOT an appropriate response to the question \"Ango ma timore?\" ('What is happening here?')?",
        "options": [
          "It lacks a verb, making it ungrammatical",
          "It does not explicitly mention the agent of the action",
          "It does not provide general information about what is happening",
          "It uses a verb form that is inappropriate for this type of question"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "The sentence emphasizes a specific object, not the broader event occurring."
      },

        "question": "In response to the question \"Itimo kwach nade?\" ('What is being done to the leopard?'), which of the following is an appropriate answer?",

          "Ineg-e",
          "Nyithindo nego kwach",

        "question": "Which of the following best represents the general syntactic pattern for Topic marking in Dholuo?",
        "options": [
          "Alpha Verb Topic X",
          "Verb Alpha Topic X",
          "Topic Alpha Verb X",
          "Verb Topic Alpha X"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Dholuo typically positions the Topic before the Alpha and Verb."

      {
        "question": "What is the significance of sentence (g) \"Kwach nyithindo nego\" compared to (f) \"Nyithindo nego kwach\"?",
        "options": [
          "(g) maintains the default sentence order while (f) marks Focus",
          "(g) assigns Topic function to \"kwach,\" making it the primary referent",
          "(f) is incorrect because \"kwach\" must always come first",
          "(g) removes the agent of the action, making it ambiguous"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "In sentence (g), 'kwach' is placed at the front to serve as the Topic."
      },
      {
        "question": "In Dholuo, when a Topic element is assigned in a sentence, how does this affect the alpha term?",
        "options": [
          "The alpha term remains in its original position",
          "The alpha term must be moved to the postverbal position",
          "The alpha term must still appear in the preverbal position",
          "The alpha term is deleted from the sentence"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "The alpha term retains its preverbal position even when a Topic is added."

        "question": "Which of the following statements correctly summarizes the relationship between Topic and sentence structure in Dholuo?",
        "options": [
          "Topic assignment always requires a change in word order",
          "Topic elements must always appear at the end of a sentence",
          "Topic assignment does not affect sentence structure in any way",
          "Topic marking is optional and does not follow any specific pattern"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Assigning a Topic typically results in fronting or reordering sentence elements for clarity."
