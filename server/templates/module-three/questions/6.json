          "The use of stress and intonation"

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Expression rules in FG focus on syntactic and morphological elements, not phonological ones like syllable structure."

        "question": "What happens to the verb form in a Dholuo sentence when an incomplete predication occurs?",
        "options": [
          "It takes a passive form",
          "It remains unchanged",

          "It takes an auxiliary verb"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "Incomplete predication results in the passive form of the verb being used."

          "Passive voice",
          "The preverbal positioning of terms"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "The verb 'oneg' shows a passive construction with 'diel' (goat) as the subject."

        "question": "What is the main factor determining whether a passive or active verb form is used in Dholuo?",

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "An alpha term (the primary participant) in predication determines verb voice selection."

        "question": "If a term is placed in the preverbal position due to a pragmatic function, what happens to the verbal predicate?",
        "options": [
          "The verb takes a passive form",
          "The verb gains an affix marking the prepositional SF of the term",
          "The verb changes to an imperative form",
          "The verb remains unchanged"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Preverbal pragmatic terms affect the verb by causing it to incorporate affixes indicating the semantic function."

        "question": "In the sentence \"Wendo wanego-ne diel\", which grammatical function causes the change in the verb form?",

          "The presence of a pragmatic function",
          "The use of an object pronoun",
          "The omission of the subject"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The pragmatic function of the preverbal element 'Wendo' triggers a verb modification."

      {
        "question": "Why do some semantic functions (SFs), such as Goal, have zero prepositional marking?",
        "options": [
          "To simplify the grammar rules",
          "To avoid inconsistencies in the general expression rules",
          "Because Dholuo does not allow prepositions",
          "Because they do not affect the sentence meaning"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Zero marking ensures consistency in how semantic functions are expressed across different contexts."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Expression rules help specify how abstract functions and roles are realized in actual speech or writing."
