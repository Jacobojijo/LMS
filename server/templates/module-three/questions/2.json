          "To determine the number of arguments a verb can take"
        ],

        "explanation": "The Subj function marks the entity from whose perspective the predication is interpreted."

        "question": "Why is the Obj function assigned in Functional Grammar?",
        "options": [
          "To introduce an additional verb in a sentence",

        "options": [
          "The language does not have active-passive transformations",
          "The order of constituents can only be explained using semantic and pragmatic functions",

          "The verbal predicate always comes before all other terms"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Subj assignment is not necessary in Dholuo grammar because constituent order is best explained using semantic and pragmatic rather than syntactic functions."

        "question": "Which of the following is TRUE regarding constituent order in Dholuo?",
        "options": [
          "The preverbal position 1 must always be occupied",
          "Verbal predicates must always appear in post-verbal positions",

          "All non-alpha terms must appear before the verb"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "In Dholuo, preverbal position 1 is consistently occupied, often by an alpha function like the Agent."

          "Otieno"

        "explanation": "In Functional Grammar, Goal is not considered an alpha function; it is a satellite or non-core semantic role."

        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "The sentence 'Otieno ong'iewo ne nyathine nanga' follows the standard constituent order with alpha and non-alpha terms placed according to their semantic function."

      {
        "question": "What determines the position of non-alpha terms in a Dholuo sentence?",

          "The complexity of the verb",
          "Their hierarchical order relative to Ben function",
          "The presence of multiple verbal predicates",
          "The number of alpha terms in the sentence"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The position of non-alpha terms in Dholuo is determined by their semantic-pragmatic hierarchy relative to the Ben function."

        "question": "Which of the following observations about Dholuo constituent order is INCORRECT?",
        "options": [
          "An alpha term must always occupy the preverbal position",
          "Non-alpha terms lower than Ben on the SFH cannot occupy position 2 if a higher-ranked term is present",
          "The Obj function is crucial for understanding active-passive relationships",
          "Semantic and pragmatic functions explain word order better than syntactic functions"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "The Obj function is not crucial for explaining active-passive relationships in Dholuo; such structures are better explained by semantic and pragmatic roles."

      {
        "question": "Why is the notion of 'syntactic function' irrelevant to the description of Dholuo?",
        "options": [
          "Dholuo does not have subject-object agreement",
          "Dholuo grammar is best explained through semantic functions rather than fixed syntactic roles",

          "Dholuo lacks a clear distinction between verbs and nouns"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "In Dholuo, syntactic functions are not primary; semantic and pragmatic roles offer a better explanation for grammatical structure."
