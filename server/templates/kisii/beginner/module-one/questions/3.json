    {
      "question": "Which of the following accurately lists all the front vowels in Ekegusii?",
      "options": [
        "/a/, /e/, /i/",
        "/e/, /ɛ/, /i/",
        "/i/, /e/, /o/",
        "/ɛ/, /a/, /o/"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Front vowels in Ekegusii include /e/, /ɛ/, and /i/, based on their articulatory position toward the front of the mouth."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the correct phonetic classification of the Ekegusii vowel /ɔ/?",
      "options": [
        "Mid-high central unrounded",
        "Open-mid back rounded",
        "Close-mid front unrounded",
        "Open front unrounded"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The vowel /ɔ/ in Ekegusii is classified as an open-mid back rounded vowel due to its tongue position and lip rounding."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which consonant cluster involves a nasal onset followed by a glottalized velar release?",
      "options": [
        "MB",
        "NG’",
        "NY",
        "NCH"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "NG’ represents a nasal onset followed by a glottalized velar release, characteristic of prenasalized velar stops."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Ekegusii, the vowel /a/ serves what critical phonological role?",
      "options": [
        "Marks glottal transitions",
        "Anchors morphological boundaries",
        "Enhances tonal stress",
        "Signals nasalized onsets"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The vowel /a/ plays a crucial role in anchoring morphological boundaries in Ekegusii word structure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Identify the cluster that represents a prenasalized palatal affricate.",
      "options": [
        "NCH",
        "ND",
        "NY",
        "NG"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "NCH represents a prenasalized palatal affricate, combining a nasal onset with a palatal stop-release."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following phonemes is non-phonemic and arises through morphophonemic derivation?",
      "options": [
        "/j/",
        "/w/",
        "/ɾ/",
        "/ʧ/"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The phoneme /w/ is non-phonemic in Ekegusii and typically surfaces due to morphophonemic processes rather than being contrastive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which feature is common to all Ekegusii vowels?",
      "options": [
        "They are always unrounded.",
        "Each has a voiced nasal counterpart.",
        "Each has a lengthened variant.",
        "Each is limited to root positions."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "All Ekegusii vowels exhibit a lengthened (or long) variant, which may be phonemically distinctive."
    },
    {
      "question": "The consonant group TW in Ekegusii typically represents:",
      "options": [
        "A nasalized alveolar fricative",
        "An affricate + glide combination",
        "A labialized alveolar plosive cluster",
        "A voiced velar nasal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "TW in Ekegusii represents a labialized alveolar plosive cluster, combining a plosive with a rounding glide."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following accurately contrasts Ekegusii fricatives using minimal pairs?",
      "options": [
        "/sɔa/ vs. /βɔa/",
        "/ɲɔkɔ/ vs. /ŋɔkɔ/",
        "/ama/ vs. /ana/",
        "/ogo/ vs. /ugo/"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The pair /sɔa/ vs. /βɔa/ demonstrates contrast between two fricatives and thus forms a true minimal pair."
    },
    {
      "question": "What articulatory description best defines the phoneme /ɲ/?",
      "options": [
        "Bilabial plosive with nasal onset",
        "Voiced alveolar plosive",
        "Palatal nasal with tongue contacting hard palate",
        "Velar nasal with ejective release"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The phoneme /ɲ/ is a palatal nasal, articulated by pressing the tongue against the hard palate."
