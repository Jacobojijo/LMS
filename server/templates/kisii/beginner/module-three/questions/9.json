      "options": [
        "Ekegusii uses auxiliary verbs for taste descriptors.",
        "Present-tense declaratives do not require the verb 'to be'.",
        "The word 'enyansu' already contains the verb.",
        "The verb 'noo-re' is implied by the noun."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Ekegusii, present-tense declarative sentences like 'Endagera enyansu!' omit the copula 'to be'; the state is implied."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following correctly demonstrates the use of the verb 'noo-' with a personal pronoun?",
      "options": ["Endagera neroo", "Noonde", "Nabeo", "Intwe nootore"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,

      "options": ["Noo bare", "Mbaiyo", "Bachire", "Ngochabare"],

      "question": "Which structure is correctly used when the subject is explicit (e.g., Paul)?",
      "options": ["Mbaiyo Paul", "Paul mbaiyo", "Paul nooare", "Paul Ngochare"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,

        "Omorugi togokonyana emeremo nere nabwate abana",
        "Omokungu tokokonyana komo tabwati ‘bana"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "‘Omorugi togokonyana emeremo nere nabwate abana’ uses the possessive copula 'nere' correctly for 'has children.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "In which case must the copula 'ere' be inserted before 'ba' when expressing possession?",
      "options": [
        "When the subject is in third person plural.",
        "When using abstract nouns.",

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The copula 'ere' appears before 'ba' when the subject is explicitly stated or named for clarity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following Ekegusii forms properly expresses 'We are here' using the location verb form?",
      "options": ["Barabwo noobare igaa", "Nootore igaa", "Inwe noomore", "Ntoiyo igaa"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "'Nootore igaa' correctly expresses location, combining 'noo-' (copula) with 'tore' (we) and 'igaa' (here)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the correct negation form of the sentence 'He is present'?",
      "options": ["Ochiire", "Taiyo", "Nooare", "Ochire"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "'Taiyo' is the negative form meaning 'He is not present,' showing negation of the copula."
    },
    {
      "question": "If 'Nimbwate endagera' means 'I have food,' what does 'Barabwo mbabwate abana' most accurately translate to?",
      "options": [
        "We have children.",
        "They are children.",
        "They have children.",
        "Children have them."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,

      "options": ["A- / E-", "Int- / Ba-", "Ere- / Aye-", "E- / U-"],
