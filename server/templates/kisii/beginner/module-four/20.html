        <h2>4.14.1 Summary of Nomenclature, Preposition & Conjunctions</h2>

        <h2>Gusii Expressions and Proverbs</h2>

        <h3>I. Cultural Function and Linguistic Significance</h3>
        <p>Proverbs and idioms act as intellectual, moral, and aesthetic pillars in Gusii culture.</p>
        <p>Serve as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linguistic ornaments in daily speech.</li>
            <li>Ethical instruments and social correctives.</li>
            <li>Tools of education, diplomacy, and wit.</li>
            <li>Encoded repositories of worldview and ancestral memory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ekegusii Proverbs</h3>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Mominchori 'imi tang'ana mosera 'ibu</strong></p>
            <p>Mominchori refers to an early riser while mosera ibu refers to a person who keeps in-doors. Rimi is morning dew. It therefore means that a person who rises up early and goes out braving the morning dew is much better economically than one who remains at home, feels lazy to venture out there to fend for himself. <strong>Lesson:</strong> We should all strive to excel and avoid laziness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>'Keumbu kiaare nkegundi 'moba</strong></p>
            <p>Ekeumbu is the ant hill in which mushrooms flourish. In essence, ekeumbu which is distant tends to be forgotten hence the mushrooms end up rotting. It therefore implies that it is easier to tend to something within our reach more effectively than one that is miles away.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Nyama 'nke yaria bokima 'kee</strong></p>
            <p>Ekee is that traditional bowl woven out of chimboba chia obori. Until recently, this was the sole plate and bowl used by our fore-fathers in ugali and other stuff. It means literally that small piece of meat can consume large quantity of ugali. The real hidden meaning is that something you might refer as a small issue can cause untold damage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>'Mwana obande, 'mamiria makendu</strong></p>
            <p>It means that one first and foremost attends to issues affecting him as a person before he can think of neighbour.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Ebiabande nsongora igoti, ebiao nkunyunyu</strong></p>
            <p>When a situation arises that you are eating/feasting at a friend's place, you are very ready and willing to attend. But when it is your turn to give, you are unwilling. We should be generous and give with happiness just as we are willing to receive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Abange mbaya, nekero bariete kiane nkaigwa bobe</strong></p>
            <p>When you have some problem, you feel good when many people come and assist in the spirit of unity. The problem is shared and happiness prevails. But, when the many people come to eat from you, you tend to be offended because you will spend a lot.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Enda n'esese</strong></p>
            <p>Esese is a dog and enda is stomach. Refers to a situation where you eat and forget that there is no tomorrow. Eat and keep some for a rainy day. However much you eat, you will certainly feel hungry.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Bwanchani mbwa 'maiso, n'emioyo etamanyaini</strong></p>
            <p>Obwanchani is love. People tend to have their inner feelings to themselves even if they appear friendly and helpful. Beware of two-faced friends who pretend to be your friends while they hate you inside.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Mosomba n'onguru</strong></p>
            <p>A good servant is one who works hard for he will reap some benefits out of his hard work and patience. Encourages those who are employed to work hard in order for them to survive lest they get fired at the slightest mistake.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Egiasireire nchera rogoro kerigerie nchera maate</strong></p>
            <p>When you have lost something, it is prudent for you to expand your search, not necessarily at the spot where you misplaced it. For instance, when you have lost a woman to another man, look for another at another place.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Geutere giote gekobamboka gekobambokere</strong></p>
            <p>Being nice to a person has a price. When he gets up and is able to support himself, more often than not turns against you. Beware.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Omosacha neritiro rire nyomba</strong></p>
            <p>In a household, the husband is like a pillar of that house. His importance cannot be disputed and therefore he should be given his due respect. Without him things can not run smoothly. Wives are warned to accord their husbands their due respect and integrity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Borabu nswenta</strong></p>
            <p>When you leave a place and promise to come back in no time, beware because you never know what you will incur just after getting out of sight. In most cases, you end up taking more time to return than you promised.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Amasikani nabuete chiseneni chieching'ondi</strong></p>
            <p>It is gratifying to maintain respect towards other people and to yourself. A sheep's tail has some very delicious meat yet it cannot equal respect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Marina marina maya, maika matamerana</strong></p>
            <p>It is easier to climb up a tree than to descend. Likewise, it is easier to create a problem than it is to find yourself out of the same.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Momenyi boko noyonga Gisore</strong></p>
            <p>Gisore was a polite man who was liked by all and sundry. When you are housed or accommodated by people, you have to live and behave just as well as Gisore. This will encourage your host to keep accommodating you till you leave most likey on your own accord.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Binto mbiang'ora, nsagasaga bikwanga</strong></p>
            <p>If you want good results, do something slowly but carefully. Speed often makes you overlook stupid mistakes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Nyasi nere namato</strong></p>
            <p>Walls have ears. Avoid talking ill of people thinking that no one is hearing. Whatever you say, know that it will filter through to someone sooner or later. Same as getutu nkemaiso.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Egetakoria ngetakonyora</strong></p>
            <p>This is like a curse. Means one does not wish you well at all. If you evade trouble, then there was no trouble at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Obwate omwabo, obwatwa koboko ocha ka, otabwati omwabo obwata 'moraa mwomo</strong></p>
            <p>This refers to situations where people tend to get favours from friends and relatives when trouble strikes. In contrast, those who have no one to look to often get nothing and end up in problems. Omoraa omwomo (dry plant) implies hardship.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Nguru chia 'momura, nchogu egwatia 'mbara</strong></p>
            <p>This proverb is used to stress the importance of a male child in a homestead. He is likened to an elephant in the sense that he is strong by nature and will be able to fight and protect the family when need arises.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Getutu kere maiso</strong></p>
            <p>The bush in which you hide has eyes.</p>
            <p>"A secret is compared to a bush in which a person hides, that is, your hiding place. On one level the proverb warns you to choose a good place to hide your secrets in order to make sure that your secrets are safe and will later be used for the well being of others. However, your bad secrets will be exposed. This Gusii proverb teaches the bad features of pretense, hypocrisy and hiding the truth.</p>
            <p>"A scripture parallel is Luke 12:1b-3: "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, that is, their hypocrisy. Nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known. Therefore, whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be proclaimed from the housetops.</p>
            <p>"This proverb is used mainly during ceremonies of initiation and during the appointment of people to leadership positions. The proverb encourages people not to pretend in carrying out their responsibilities, but rather to serve faithfully and openly. What they do in pretense or "in the dark" will always haunt them later."</p>

            <li>Place (spatial consciousness)</li>
            <li>History (cultural memory)</li>

        <p>Children inherit names from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deceased/living relatives, irrespective of gender norms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reflects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ancestral embodiment</li>
            <li>Spiritual continuity</li>
            <li>Family honor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A boy may bear a female name (e.g., Atieno), and vice versa.</p>

        <h3>VIII. Summary: A Complex and Symbolic Naming Tradition</h3>
        <p>The Gusii naming system is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Philosophical</strong> — Reflecting time, space, spirit.</li>
            <li><strong>Sociological</strong> — Anchored in kinship and historical memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Geographical</strong> — Emphasizes locational identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Spiritual</strong> — Reveres ancestors and metaphysical lineage.</li>
            <li><strong>Contextual</strong> — A name is not a tag, but a narrative of origin.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Price Asking (rigori nirenga): Linguistic Economics in Gusii Culture</h2>

        <h3>I. "Nirenga" as Core Economic Lexicon</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>"Nirenga" = Price/value; central in Gusii market and domestic discourse.</li>
            <li>Utilized in formal commerce and informal bargaining alike.</li>
            <li>Anchors conversations around value, exchange, and worth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>II. Asking Price: rigori nirenga Structures</h3>
        <h4>Standard Format:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>"Nirenga rigori?" – "How much does it cost?"</li>
            <li>Structure emphasizes object → price sequence (noun precedes inquiry).</li>
            <li>E.g., Rigori rie ritoke nirenga? – "What is the price of the banana?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Alternative Structure:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Emphasis on chibesa (money) → "X chibesa irenga?"</li>
            <li>Highlights currency over item.</li>
            <li>E.g., Inaki okooni omosi? – "How much is the sugar-cane?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>III. Nduserie: The Art of Bargaining</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Nduseria/ ngeerie = Negotiating price; socio-linguistic ritual.</li>
            <li>Emphasizes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Respectful disagreement with initial prices.</li>
                    <li>Polite insistence for discounts.</li>
                    <li>Mutual economic fairness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reflects relational intelligence, cultural etiquette, and market diplomacy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>IV. Socio-Pragmatic Importance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rigori nirenga is a marker of linguistic fluency and economic tact.</li>
            <li>Embeds economic action within social norms, relational speech, and communal expectations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>V. Summary: The Economics of Expression</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dual syntactic pathways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Item-centered: "Rigori ndireri X ?"</li>
                    <li>Currency-centered: "chibesa irenga X ?"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Bargaining (nduserie rigori) is not confrontation but cultural dialogue.</li>
            <li>Mastery reflects interpersonal finesse, market literacy, and social embeddedness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>III. Anatomical Origins of Spatial Terms</h3>
        <p>Prepositions rooted in body metaphors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ase obosio bwa ← (at the head)</li>
            <li>Ase enda ya ← (at the stomach)</li>
            <li>Ase okogoro kwa ← (at the foot)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reflects a cognitively embodied spatial logic in Ekegusii.</p>

        <h3>IV. The Triadic Nuance of "For"</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asengencho</strong> – Denotes purpose or target
                <ul>
                    <li>E.g., Ngokora emeremo asengencho yechibesa – I work for money</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ase</strong> – Implies cause, gratitude, or justification
                <ul>
                    <li>E.g., Mbuyamono ase endagera – Thank you for the food</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Korera</strong> – Used for institutions or organizations
                <ul>
                    <li>E.g., Ngokorera UCRC – I work for UCRC</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>V. "With": Na vs. Amo na</h3>
        <h4>Na – General use with nouns</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ngocha na Kerubo – I come with Achieng'</li>
            <li>Cannot combine with pronoun suffixes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Amo na – Used for people and pronouns</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ngocha nere – I come with him</li>
            <li>Allows suffixation: nainche (with me), naintwe (with us)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>VI. Possession and Classification: Role of "Ye"</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ye</strong> = of/possessive</li>
            <li>Amabere y'omwana – the children's milk</li>
            <li>Indicates ownership, association, and categorical relation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>VII. Summary: Prepositions as Cultural Grammar</h3>
        <p>Prepositions in Ekegusii:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are metaphor-rich, rooted in physical embodiment.</li>
            <li>Distinguish between types of companionship and causal relationships.</li>
            <li>Offer syntactic flexibility for expressing spatial, social, and semantic relations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Understanding them enables deeper command over Ekegusii relational dynamics and communicative precision.</p>

        <h2>I. Relative Pronouns in Ekegusii: "Erio" and Subordinate Syntax</h2>

        <h3>Definition & Role</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Relative pronouns link principal clauses to subordinate ones, expanding syntactic depth.</li>
            <li>Central marker: "Erio" — denotes "that"/"so that" in English but is not a preposition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Connector: "erio"</h3>
        <p>Moderate-tone "erio" = that/so that</p>

        <h3>Usage Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduces clauses of purpose, condition, indirect speech, and intentionality.</li>
            <li>Often occurs as "na erio":
                <ul>
                    <li>"Na" (so) + "Erio" (that) = Future intent or desired outcome</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ngosaba erio inyore endagera – I pray so that I may get food.</li>
                <li>Ere agokora emeremo erio abanto bache – He works so that people may come.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Structural Composition</h3>
        <p>Principal Clause + (na) erio + Dependent Clause</p>
        <p>→ Enables intentional, hypothetical, and subjunctive constructions.</p>

        <h2>II. Causal Connectives: Expressing Justification and Motivation</h2>

        <h3>Primary Causal Conjunction: "Asengencho"</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Denotes explicit reason or cause (because).</li>
            <li>Used in indicative contexts explaining current or past events.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ngominyoka asengencho inyorire – I run because I'm late.</li>
                <li>Ere angete gokwana asengencho twomanete – He refused to speak to me because we quarreled.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Variants and Regional Forms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asengencho</strong> – commonly used and semantically neutral.</li>
            <li><strong>Ekiagera</strong> – dialectal equivalent with similar causal force.</li>
            <li>All are intelligible across Gusii dialects but carry regional coloring.</li>
        </ul>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>→ Shows syntactic symmetry and thematic pairing.</p>

        <h2>V. Cause and Purpose Distinction: Precision in Functional Conjunctions</h2>

        <h3>A. Reason-based Conjunctions (Cause):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asengencho/ Ekiagera</strong> → All denote "because"</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            <p>→ Ngosoma Ekegusii ekiagera ntagete gokemanya – I study Ekegusii because I want to know it.</p>
