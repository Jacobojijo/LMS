        <h3>1.2.1.5 Order of Determiners</h3>
        <p>Normally, in one Dholuo Noun phrase, we can have the head noun, a partitive article, a quantifier, a demonstrative and one or more relative clauses. Below is a possible Noun phrase consisting of a head noun and all these determiners.</p>
        <p>Nyithindo moko ariyo matindo mohero tugo ka</p>
        <p>'Those little children who like playing'</p>
        <p>If we fix the positon of the head noun and do not allow any determiner to come before it, as Dholuo grammar requires, we can have several potential phrases which include the following:</p>
        <p>Nyithindo mako ariyo matindo mohero tugo ka</p>
        <p>Nyithindo ariyo mako matindo mohero tugo ka</p>
        <p>Nyithindo matindo ariyo moko mohero tugo ka</p>
        <p>Nyithindo mohero tugo moko ariyo matindo ka</p>
        <p>Nyithindo ka moko ariyo matindo mohero tugo</p>
        <p>Nyithindo moko matindo ariyo mohero tugo ka</p>
        <p>Nyithindo ariyo matindo moko mohero tuga ka</p>
        <p>Nyithindo ariyo matindo moko ka mohero tugo</p>
        <p>Nyithindo matindo moko ariyo mohero tugo ka</p>
        <p>Nyithindo matindo mahero tugo moko ariyo ka</p>
        <p>Nyithindo mohera tugo matindo moko ariyo ka</p>
        <p>It is noted that the preferred position for the demonstrative is the phrase final position. In this position, everything occurring before it is supposed to be within the scope of the demonstrative. It is this question of scope which seems to be at the root of intuitions concerning the acceptability of the various permutations. One observes that all the obviously acceptable arrangements have the demonstrative at the end and all the obviously unacceptable ones have it somewhere in the middle of the phrase - not at the end. (The problem with (11) seems to be based on the scope of [matindo,] which is apparently shifted to [ tugo,] away from [nyithindo.]</p>
        <p>In gen2eral, the most preferred order seems to be:</p>
        <p>]HN-PA-Quan-RW-RC-DEM]</p>
        <p>1      2      3       4       5     6</p>
        <p>(where: HN = Head Noun; PA = Partitive Article; Quan. = Quantifier; RW = Relativized word; RC = Relative Clause; Dem. â€” Demonstrative)</p>
        <p>The most acceptable variations are in positions 2, 3 and 4. The term 'relativized word' has been used here to capture the differences between the single-word relative clause and the type that contains more than one word.</p>
        <p>There is one notable case in which the demonstrative tends to occur immediately after the head noun. This is when the head noun shows time, e.g.</p>
        <p>Chieng'ne ma Yesu oduogo wanamor gilala.</p>
        <p>On the day Jesus comes back we shall be exceedingly happy</p>
        <p>Secheka ma ne wawuoye kodi to niparo?</p>
        <p>'But what were you thinking of at the time we were talking?'</p>
        <p>In all such cases the demonstrative can be placed at the end of the noun phrase</p>
