        <h3>1.2.1.3 Quantification in Noun Phrases</h3>
        <p>Quantification</p>
        <p>Like other languages, Dholuo has quantifiers in the form of cardinal numbers, ordinals, or adjectives of relative quantity. In a noun phrase, the head comes before the quantifier as in the following examples.</p>
        <p>Adwaro diek ariyo</p>
        <p>I want two goats.</p>
        <p>Koth chwe e dwe mar abich</p>
        <p>It rains in the fifth month (May).</p>
        <p>Ruoth nigi rombe mathoth</p>
        <p>The chief has many sheep.</p>
        <p>Quantification by a cardinal is straightforward once we have a number such as [ariyo 'two'] as shown above. So is quantification by adjectives of relative quantity, e.g. [mathoth 'many'] as shown above, whose morphological constitution and other relevant properties will be discussed together with the other relative constructions (clauses).</p>
        <p>Dholuo ordinals, however, require further explanation. In general, the number of ordinals a language has corresponds one-to-one to the number of its cardinals. Nevertheless, languages differ in how they form their ordinals morphologically.</p>
        <p>In Dholuo, the ordinal corresponding to ['first'] in English is derived from the verb [kwongo] to come first' by prefixing the relativizing morpheme [ma] to a stem consisting of [kwongo] and the perfective marker [o.] Thus [ma + o + kwongo] gives us the word [mokwongo]['first]' after a vowel deletion or assimilation process.</p>
        <p>The word for ['last'] is similarly derived from the verb [gik] 'to be last, to end'. Thus [ma + o + gik] gives us the word [mogik 'last']. All the other ordinals are phrasal words consisting of the word [mar] 'of' and a cardinal,</p>
        <p>e.g. [mar ariyo] (of two) 'second', [mar ochiko] (of nine) 'ninth' [mar mia achie] l (of a hundred) 'one hundredth', etc.</p>
