        <h3>1.1 Orthographic Conventions</h3>
        
        <h4>1.1.1 Introduction</h4>
        <p>Orthographic conventions in Dholuo grammar refer to the rules and guidelines for writing correctly in the Dholuo language. These conventions include aspects such as spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and the use of spaces and hyphens.</p>
        
        <h4>Spelling</h4>
        <p>Spelling conventions in Dholuo involve the correct formation of words, including the use of consonants and vowels.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
            Standard spelling: "nyathi" (child)<br>
            Irregular spelling: "ng'ato" (person)</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Capitalization</h4>
        <p>Capitalization rules in Dholuo are similar to those in English, where uppercase letters are used at the beginning of sentences and for proper nouns.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
            Beginning of a sentence: "Nyathi ohero ng'ato." (The child loves the person.)<br>
            Proper nouns: "Odhiambo ni Nairobi." (Odhiambo is in Nairobi.)</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Punctuation</h4>
        <p>Punctuation marks in Dholuo help clarify the meaning of sentences and improve readability. Common punctuation marks include periods, commas, question marks, and exclamation points.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
            Period: "Nyathi ohero ng'atno." (The child loves the person.)<br>
            Comma: "Odhiambo, nyathi, gi Achieng'." (Odhiambo, the child, and Achieng'.)<br>
            Question mark: "Be Nyathi ohero ng'ato?" (Does the child love the person?)<br>
            Exclamation point: "Nyathi ohero ng'ato!" (The child loves the person!)</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Spaces</h4>
        <p>Spaces are used to separate words and sentences in Dholuo, just as in English.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
            Word separation: "Nyathi ohero ng'ato." (The child loves the person.)<br>
            Sentence separation: "Nyathi ohero ng'ato. Odhiambo ni Nairobi." (The child loves the person. Odhiambo is in Nairobi.)</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Hyphens</h4>
        <p>Hyphens are used in Dholuo to connect words or parts of words, especially in compound terms.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
            Compound terms: "nyathi-gi" (their child)<br>
            Word break: "ng'at-gi" (their person)</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>These orthographic conventions ensure that written Dholuo is clear, readable, and standardized, allowing for effective communication.</p>
        
        <h3>Dholuo Consonants</h3>
        <p>Dholuo has altogether twenty-six consonants, including two semivowels and five nasal-stop compounds. There is a one-to-one correspondence between these consonant sounds and their orthographic symbols. This makes it easy to interpret the consonantal properties of any written word. Dholuo orthography makes use of ten digraphs to represent some fricatives, some nasals, and all the nasal-stop compounds.</p>
        
        <p>Fricatives are consonant sounds produced by forcing air through a narrow channel created by placing two articulators close together, resulting in a turbulent airflow. They Include, F, H and TH</p>
        
        <p>Semivowels are consonants that function similarly to vowels in terms of their phonetic properties. They are also called "glides" because they involve a smooth transition from a consonant to a vowel sound. Dholuo has two main semivowels: W and Y.</p>
        
        <p>Nasal-stop compound are combinations of a nasal consonant followed by a stop consonant. These compounds are essential in the phonetic structure of the language. They include MD, ND, NG', NY and NDH</p>
        
        <p>Digraphs are pairs of letters that together represent a single sound (phoneme) which differs from the sounds of the individual letters)</p>
        
        <p>The important thing to remember about the digraphs is that each of them represents only one phoneme and not a cluster of phonemes.</p>
        
        <p>For example, the digraph [dh] in the word Dholuo represents only one sound - the voiced interdental fricative [ð]. Those who want to read the word correctly must resist the temptation to produce an aspirated [d]. They should produce a sound similar to the sound of [ th] in the English word [this] or [that]. Similarly, the digraph [ny] - as in the word [nyako] 'girl' - represents only one consonant sound'.</p>
        
        <p>The following is the list of Dholuo Consonants phonemes in International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and the corresponding orthographic representations.</p>

        <h3>Dholuo Vowels</h3>
        <p>The phonemic inventory of Dholuo vowels consists of the single low, front vowel /a/ and four pairs of other vowels.</p>
        <p>Dholuo orthography under-differentiates these vowel phonemes. The whole system uses only five symbols, one for /a/ and one for each of the four pairs. This creates many homographs among words distinguished only on the basis of the tongue-root positions of their vowels.</p>
        <p>For instance, in isolation one cannot tell whether the orthographic word pith represents /pi⊖/ 'hill' or /pi⊖/ 'wealth (having many cattle, goats, etc.)'. However, in normal reading (reading in context) such homographs do not seem to create any problems to Dholuo speakers.</p>
        <p>One clear advantage of this system is that it accommodates in reading and writing both personal and regional differences based on vowel tongue-root positions, which are rampant, especially where there are no minimal pairs.</p>
