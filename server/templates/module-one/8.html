        <h3>1.4.4 Relative Pronouns and Connectives</h3>
        
        <h4>Relative Pronouns</h4>
        <p>Generally, a relative pronoun is a pronominal form which replaces a nominal construction (or term) occurring in a higher clause where it is repeated in an embedded clause. For example, in the sentence:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Mano dhiang' ma onge tunge<br>
            'That is a cow which does not have (its) horns.'
        </div>
        
        <p>The word <em>ma</em> is supposed to be a pronominal representation of the preceding nominal term <em>dhiang'</em>. By bracketing conventions, <em>dhiang'</em> belongs to a higher clause than <em>ma</em>. This information is diagrammatically representable as follows:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            [Mano dhiang' [ma onge tunge}]
        </div>
        
        <p>where each pair of brackets encloses one hierarchy of clause structure. The innermost brackets enclose the most deeply embedded clause for any given complex sentence.</p>
        
        <p>The element [ma] is the only relative pronoun in Dholuo. Often it stands as a separate word, but when the following word begins with a vowel, [ma] tends to lose its vowel - ending up as a mere prefix of the next word, e.g.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ng'at ma neno<br>
            'A person who is awake'<br><br>
            Ng'at moneno jakuo.<br>
            'The person who has seen the thief'
        </div>
        
        <p>This reduction of [ma], as (b) shows, does not take place in some cases e.g. [ma onge] but not [monge] 'which is absent/who does not have'). No general rule exists for these exceptions and the speaker of the language has to learn them as such.</p>
        
        <h4>Connectives</h4>
        <p>Dholuo has a small set of words used to combine words, phrases, or clauses as the case may be. The commonest coordinators in Dholuo are [gi] and [to], meaning (roughly) [and] and [but], respectively. Their use is illustrated by the following constructions:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Otieno gi wuon gero ot.<br>
            'Otieno and his father are building a house.'<br><br>
            Japuonj olalo bugena ariyo gi kalembena adek.<br>
            'The teacher has lost two of my books and three of my pens.'<br><br>
            Akelo ndiko to nyamin somo.<br>
            'Akelo is writing, but (while) her sister is reading.'<br><br>
            Awachone ni ochungi to ok owinji.<br>
            'I am telling him to get up, but he doesn't listen,'
        </div>
        
        <p>In the coordination of clauses, the word [kendo] is used instead of [gi] if the conjoined clauses have the same subject. For instance, the English sentence 'John goes and comes back every day' may be rendered in Dholuo as:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            John dhi kendo duogo pile ka pile.
        </div>
        
        <p>In this type of construction [kendo] may be replaced by [to] Thus it could also be expressed as:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            John dhi to duogo pile ka pile.
        </div>
        
        <p>Moreover, when the conjoined activities are taking place at the same time, to is the preferred coordinator. For example, when someone sleeps as he eats, the tendency (among speakers) is to say something like:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Opiyo chiemo to nindo rather than Opiyo chiemo kendo nindo.
        </div>
        
        <p>Generally, the major function of [gi] which [to] is completely unable to perform is conjoining terms designating participants in a given state of affairs. This means, for example, that [to] cannot replace [ gi] in (a). In cases like the four examples above, while [to] cannot replace [gi] completely, it can support it - leading to the formation of a sentence such as the following:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Japuonj Olalo bugena ariyo to gi kalembena adek.
        </div>
        
        <p>We can therefore say that of the three Dholuo coordinators [gi, to, and kendo] [to] is the least marked in terms of collocational possibilities.</p>
        
        <p>Since subordination gives the construction in question an adverbial status, the conjoiners that function as subordinators in Dholuo have also appeared in our discussion of adverbials. Such conjoiners are associated with functions such as:</p>
        
        <p><strong>REASON</strong>, e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">
            Ok adhi sikul nikech wiya bara<br>
            'I am not going to school because I have a headache.'<br><br>
            Notuo emomiyo ne ok obiro<br>
            'He was sick (and) that is why he did not come.'
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>CONCESSION</strong>, e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">
            Kata ahere (kamano) to ok anyal kende<br>
            'Much as I love her, I cannot marry her.'
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>CONDITION</strong>, e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">
            Ka koth ochwe to kik ibi<br>
            'If it rains, (then) do not come.'<br><br>
            Kik ibika, koth chwee.
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>TIME</strong>, e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">
            Ne gidonjo ka Ching' podho.<br>
            'They arrived at sunset.'
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>COMPARISON</strong>, e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">
            Ode rieny kaka sulwe<br>
            'His house shines like a Star.'
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>CAPACITY (POSITION)</strong>, e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">
            Obiro kaka jatendwa<br>
            'He is coming (in his capacity) as our leader'
        </div>
    </div>
