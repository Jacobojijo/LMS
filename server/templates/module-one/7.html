        <h3>1.4.3 Demonstrative and Interrogative Pronouns</h3>
        <h4>Demonstrative Pronouns</h4>
        <p>The communicative function of a demonstrative element is to or single out a person or object that is talked about. When such an element singles out a given Object (or person) by simply modifying the word (or phrase) that designates the object in question, it is referred to as a demonstrative adjective.</p>
        <p>Then, on the other hand, it completely replaces what it singles out m a given construction it is called a demonstrative pronoun. Thus, for instance, in the two English sentences</p>
        <p>1. That book is mine.'<br>
        2. That is mine.'</p>
        <p>we have two occurrences of the demonstrative 'that' used as an adjective and as a pronoun in (a) and (b), respectively.</p>
        <p>In their adjectival role, Dholuo demonstratives occur in the following forms:</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Singular</th>
                <th>Plural</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ni<br>'this'</td>
                <td>gi<br>'these'</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>The qualified object is proximate to the addressor and may also be proximate to the addressee.</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Singular</th>
                <th>Plural</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>no<br>'that'</td>
                <td>go<br>'those'</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>The qualified object is closer to the addressee than to the addressor.</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Singular</th>
                <th>Plural</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>cha<br>'that'</td>
                <td>ka<br>'those'</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>The qualified object is away from both the addressor and the addressee.</p>
        <p>Examples of the use of these demonstratives adjectives are provided by the following constructions:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p>1. Wuoyi ni dwari (sg. Near Addressor)<br>
            'This boy wants you.'</p>
            <p>2. Yawuoyi gi dwari (Pl., Near Addressor)<br>
            'These boys want you.'</p>
            <p>3. Nyako no osiepna (Sg., closer to Addressee<br>
            'That girl is my friend.'</p>
            <p>4. Nyiri go osiepena/osiepega. (Pl., Closer to Addressee)<br>
            'Those girls are my friends.'</p>
            <p>5. Dhako cha binyore (Sg., Away from Addressor and Addressee)<br>
            'That woman is getting hut.'</p>
            <p>6. Mon ka hinyore (Pl., Away from Addressor and Addressee)<br>
            'Those women are getting hurtmurting each other.'</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Every demonstrative pronoun in Dholuo is a compound (linguistic) element consisting of the usually bound form [ma] and one of the adjectives given above. This gives us three pairs of demonstrative pronouns, namely:</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Singular</th>
                <th>Plural</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ma-e<br>'this'</td>
                <td>Ma-gi<br>'these'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ma-no<br>'that'</td>
                <td>Ma-go<br>'those'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ma-cha<br>'that'</td>
                <td>ma-ka<br>'those'</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>The difference between mano/mago and macha/maka corresponds to the difference between their adjectival constituents as explained above.</p>
        <p>In everyday language use [ma] is often used alone instead of ma-e, but this leads to no ambiguity since all the other compounds always occur in full. The use of these demonstrative pronouns leads to the construction of sentences such as:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p>1. <i>Mae wach mokela iri</i><br>
            'This is the matter that has brought me to you.'</p>
            <p>2. <i>Mago chike Nyasaye</i><br>
            'Those are God's commandments</p>
            <p>3. <i>Macha nyar jatelo</i><br>
            'That is the big (leader's) daughter.'</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Interrogative Pronouns</h4>
        <p>Dholuo has three interrogative pronouns corresponding to the English words 'who', 'what', and 'which'. The following table shows the pronouns (with variant forms where available).</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Singular</th>
                <th>Plural</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ng'a/ng'awa/ng'ano</td>
                <td>—gini, 'who'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ang'o/ang'owa/ang'ono</td>
                <td>—gini, 'what'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mane</td>
                <td>mage 'which'</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>The alternative forms for 'who' and 'what' usually occur in free variation, though many speakers (including the writer) find the longer forms strong and rude. These Interrogative pronouns occur in sentences such as:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p>1. <i>Ng'a ma dwaro rech?</i><br>
            'Who wants fish'</p>
            <p>2. <i>Ng'agini mani e ot kanyo?</i><br>
            'Who are there in the house?'</p>
            <p>3. <i>Ukelo ang'o?</i><br>
            'What have you brought?'</p>
            <p>4. <i>Odwaro diek mage?</i></p>
            <p>5. <i>Diek mage modwaro?</i><br>
            'Which goats does he want?</p>
