        <h3>1.3 Review & Practice</h3>
        <h4>1.3.1 Summary of Orthographic Conventions & Noun Phrases</h4>
        
        <h4>Dholuo Consonants</h4>
        <p>Dholuo has 26 consonants, including two semivowels and five nasal-stop compounds, with a one-to-one correspondence between consonant sounds and their orthographic symbols. This feature makes reading and writing relatively straightforward.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Categories of Dholuo Consonants:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fricatives: Produced by forcing air through a narrow channel, creating a turbulent airflow. These include F, H, and TH (âŠ–).</li>
            <li>Semivowels (Glides): Consonants that behave like vowels in pronunciation and transition smoothly between sounds. Dholuo has W and Y.</li>
            <li>Nasal-Stop Compounds: Nasal consonants followed by stop consonants, crucial in Dholuo phonetics. Examples include MD, ND, NG', NY, and NDH.</li>
            <li>Digraphs: Two letters representing a single phoneme, distinct from the sounds of the individual letters. Examples:
                <ul>
                    <li>DH in Dholuo represents [Ã°], similar to "th" in this or that.</li>
                    <li>NY in nyako ("girl") represents [É²], a nasal palatal sound</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Dholuo Vowels</h4>
        <p>Dholuo has five vowel symbols (A, E, I, O, U) but represents ten phonemic vowels due to tongue-root position distinctions. The system under-differentiates these phonemes, leading to homographsâ€”words that look the same but differ in pronunciation and meaning.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Features of Dholuo Vowels:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Five orthographic vowel symbols: A, E, I, O, U.</li>
            <li>Ten phonemic vowels due to tongue-root position differences.</li>
            <li>Homographs: Words spelled identically but pronounced differently in context.</li>
            <li>Example: pith can mean "hill" or "wealth", depending on pronunciation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Definiteness in Dholuo Noun Phrases</h4>
        <p><strong>How Definiteness is Expressed in Dholuo</strong></p>
        
        <h4>Contextual Definiteness</h4>
        <p>In Dholuo, a noun can be definite or indefinite depending on the context rather than explicit grammatical markers.</p>
        <p>If a noun is commonly known in a given situation, it does not require additional marking for definiteness.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Wadwaro japuonj. â†’ We want a teacher. (Indefinite, any teacher)</p>
            <p>Wadwaro japuonj. â†’ We want the teacher. (Definite, referring to a known teacher)</p>
        </div>
        <p>The same sentence may have different meanings depending on the situation.</p>
        
        <h4>Demonstratives as Definiteness Markers</h4>
        <p>Dholuo uses demonstratives such as [no], [cha], [go], and [ka] to indicate previous mention or shared experience.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>[no] and [go] â†’ Used when the referent is still the latest topic of conversation.</li>
            <li>[cha] and [ka] â†’ Used when the referent has been followed by other topics in discourse.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Wadwaro japuonj no â†’ We want that teacher (the one just mentioned or nearby).</p>
            <p>Wadwaro jopuonj go â†’ We want those teachers (recently mentioned or nearby).</p>
            <p>Wadwaro japuonj cha â†’ We want that teacher (one mentioned earlier or further away).</p>
            <p>Wadwaro jopuonj ka â†’ We want those teachers (previously discussed but not recent).</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Quantification in Dholuo Noun Phrases</h4>
        <p><strong>Types of Quantifiers in Dholuo</strong></p>
        <p>Like many languages, Dholuo uses different forms of quantification within noun phrases, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cardinal numbers (e.g., ariyo "two")</li>
            <li>Ordinals (e.g., mokwongo "first")</li>
            <li>Adjectives of relative quantity (e.g., mathoth "many")</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Adwaro diek ariyo. â†’ I want two goats. (Cardinal number)</p>
            <p>Koth chwe e dwe mar abich. â†’ It rains in the fifth month (May). (Ordinal number)</p>
            <p>Ruoth nigi rombe mathoth. â†’ The chief has many sheep. (Adjective of quantity)</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Formation of Ordinal Numbers in Dholuo</h4>
        <p>Unlike cardinal numbers, ordinals in Dholuo require morphological modification. The first and last ordinal numbers are derived from verbs, while the rest are formed using the word mar ("of") followed by a cardinal number.</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Ordinal</th>
                <th>Formation</th>
                <th>Meaning</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>mokwongo</td>
                <td>ma + o + kwongo ("come first")</td>
                <td>First</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mogik</td>
                <td>ma + o + gik ("be last")</td>
                <td>Last</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>mar ariyo</td>
                <td>mar + ariyo ("of two")</td>
                <td>Second</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>mar ochiko</td>
                <td>mar + ochiko ("of nine")</td>
                <td>Ninth</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>mar mia achiel</td>
                <td>mar + mia achiel ("of one hundred")</td>
                <td>One hundredth</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Ruodh mar adek. â†’ The third chief.</p>
            <p>Dwe mar ochiko. â†’ The ninth month.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Relative Clauses in Dholuo</h4>
        <p><strong>Function of Relative Clauses</strong></p>
        <p>When a noun's reference cannot be clarified by determiners alone, Dholuo employs relative clausesâ€”embedded sentences that provide additional details about a noun. These clauses are introduced by the relative morpheme [ma], which sometimes attaches as a clitic.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Example of a Basic Relative Clause:</strong></p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Ruoth ma onge dhako rach. â†’ A chief who does not have a wife is bad.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Types of Relative Clauses</h4>
        <p>Linguists distinguish between two types of relative clauses:</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>Definition</th>
                <th>Example in Dholuo</th>
                <th>Translation</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Restrictive</td>
                <td>Specifies a necessary characteristic of the noun</td>
                <td>Ruoth ma onge dhako rach.</td>
                <td>A chief who does not have a wife is bad.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Non-restrictive</td>
                <td>Adds extra information about the noun</td>
                <td>Kata Otieno, ma onge dhako, bende dwaro bedo ruoth.</td>
                <td>Even Otieno, who does not have a wife, wants to become the chief.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>ðŸ”¹ Key Difference: The restrictive relative clause helps identify the noun, while the non-restrictive one adds background information without limiting the noun's identity.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Structure of Relative Clauses in Dholuo</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The relative morpheme [ma] introduces the clause.</li>
            <li>It often appears as a free word or as a clitic (attaching to words).</li>
            <li>If the word begins with a vowel, [ma] loses its final vowel through assimilation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Ngat marach. â†’ A bad person.</p>
            <p>Ring'o ma jaduong' ohero. â†’ The meat that the elder likes.</p>
            <p>Nyathi mong'eyo jonyuolne. â†’ A child who knows its parents.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>The Order of Determiners in Dholuo Noun Phrases</h4>
        <p>In Dholuo, noun phrases follow a fixed order: Head Noun (HN) - Partitive Article (PA) - Quantifier (Quan) - Relativized Word (RW) - Relative Clause (RC) - Demonstrative (DEM). The demonstrative (DEM) is preferred at the end, as it applies to all preceding elements.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Example of Correct Order:</strong></p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Nyithindo moko ariyo matindo mohero tugo ka.</p>
            <p>(Those little children who like playing.)</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Unacceptable Order:</strong></p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Nyithindo ka moko ariyo matindo mohero tugo. (Incorrect placement of "ka")</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="key-point">
            <p>ðŸ”¹ Exception: When the head noun represents time, the demonstrative can come immediately after it.</p>
