        <p>Noun (Head): The main noun in the phrase.</p>

        <h4>1.2.1.2 Definiteness in Noun Phrases</h4>
        <p>Definiteness</p>
        <p>Definiteness in noun phrases of the Dholuo language refers to whether a noun or noun phrase is specific and identifiable within a given context. While English often uses articles such as "the" (definite) and "a/an" (indefinite) to mark definiteness, Dholuo does not use articles. Instead, definiteness is conveyed through context, demonstratives, possessives</p>
        <p>When common knowledge per se is the basis of definiteness, there is no grammatical or lexical marker for it in Dholuo. Thus, for example, in a community where there is no teacher, when one says:</p>
        <p>Wadwaro japuonj.</p>
        <p>We want a teacher.</p>
        <p>The referent of 'japuonj' is not specific. However, when some parents go to a particular teacher's house and say:</p>
        <p>Wadwaro japuonj.</p>
        <p>We want a teacher.</p>
        <p>It is normally understood to mean the teacher who lives in that house; and the referent of 'japuonj' in this case is understood to be specific.</p>
        <p>Definiteness based on previous mention is usually marked by the demonstrative morphemes [no] and [cha] (and their plural forms [go] and [ka], respectively). Both [no] and [cha] correspond to "that" in English - the former referring to something proximate to the Second Person but not to the First Person, while the latter refers to something not proximate to either the First or Second Person.</p>
        <p>Wadwaro japuonj no(Singular)...We want that teacher</p>
        <p>Wadwaro jopuonj go(Plural) ...We want those teachers</p>
        <p>Wadwaro japuonj cha(Singular) ...We want that teacher</p>
        <p>Wadwaro jopuonj ka(Plural) ...We want those teachers</p>
        <p>For instance, when referring to an affair which has been mentioned a short while ago, a speaker may say to his interlocutor</p>
        <p>'Ok adwar winjo wach no kendo'</p>
        <p>I don't want to hear that matter again.</p>
        <p>Similarly, when referring to something that was discussed some time ago, one may say</p>
        <p>'Wach cha norumo nango?'</p>
        <p>How did that matter end?</p>
        <p>In general, these are used to indicate (with respect to definiteness) not just previous mention, but the whole phenomenon of previous experience. The following sentences will further illustrate this point.</p>
        <p>Ngat cha newuoyo nade?</p>
        <p>How was that man talking?</p>
        <p>Paro no chanda ahinya.</p>
        <p>That thought disturbs me very much.'</p>
        <p>Mon go ne onge gi chiemo.</p>
        <p>'Those women did not have food.'</p>
        <p>Yawuoyi ka ne dwaro kwinyowa</p>
        <p>Those boys wanted to provoke us</p>
        <p>The choice between [no/go] or [cha,'ka] is based on when the affair, event, or object referred to was mentioned or experienced prior to the time at which the referring expression is uttered. Generally, [no/go] is used when the previously mentioned matter or experience has not been followed by any other that can be perceived as the referent of the demonstrative.</p>
        <p>If, on the other hand, the is intended to refer to something already succeeded by one or more utterances or experiences that could as referent or referents of the then [cha/ka] is used.</p>
        <p>Although, as we pointed out above, the contrast between definite and indefinite (or specific and nonspecific) referents is usually not expressed overtly, the partitive [moro] 'some, a certain' [moko] is often used as an indefinite article, where it is considered appropriate to do so. This point is illustrated by sentences such as</p>
        <p>Askari biro ka '</p>
        <p>An askari is here.'</p>
        <p>Askari moro biro ka</p>
        <p>A certain askari is coming here.'</p>
        <p>Nyithindo tugo e nam</p>
        <p>Children are playing in the lake.'</p>
        <p>Nyithindo moko tugo</p>
        <p>Some children are playing in the lake.'</p>
