            <h3>2.5 Adverbials</h3>
            <h4>2.5.1 Introduction</h4>
            <p>In Dholuo grammar, adverbials are linguistic elements that modify verbs, adjectives, or entire sentences by providing additional information about time, place, manner, frequency, degree, reason, and purpose. Adverbials help specify the circumstances of an action, making speech more precise and contextually rich.</p>
            <p>In this approach, adverbs are sub classified in terms of what they predicate or are predications over. The subclasses are:</p>
            
            <h4>2.5.2 Predictions over Events, Actions and Propositions</h4>
            <h4>Predictions over Events, Actions</h4>
            <p>This includes such adverbial functions as:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Locative</strong> - which indicates where something is located, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Ng'ato nindo e tiend yath ('Someone is sleeping under the tree')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Directional</strong> - which indicates the physical orientation or direction of a static or moving body as the case may be, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Od sikul ochung' ka ochomo nam. ('The school building stands facing the lake.')</div>
            <div class="example">Nyithindo dhi (e) sikul ('Children are going to school.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Durative</strong> - which shows the duration of a given event, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Ne gitiyo (kuom) higni apar ('They worked for ten years.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Extent</strong> - which shows the spatial equivalent of duration, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Asewuotho mael abich ('I have walked five miles.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Point time</strong> - which marks the time at which an event takes place, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Kenyatta notho higa mokalo ('Kenyatta died last year.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Manner</strong> - which indicates the way in which an event takes place, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Gari ringo matek ('The train goes fast.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Instrument</strong> - which indicates what is employed (usually as a tool) in carrymg out something, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Andiko gi kalam ('I am writing with a pen.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Accompaniment</strong> - which indicates that one nominal acts as an accompanying participant to another nominal, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Aloo dhi nam gi wuon ('Aloo is going to the lake with her father.')</div>
            
            <p>The word gi 'with' in (a) above is homophonous to the gi 'and' which occurs in the following sentence.</p>
            <div class="example">Aloo gi wuon dhii nam ('Aloo and her father are going to the lake.')</div>
            <p>where Aloo gi wuon is a compound subject.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Equipment</strong> - which, although introduced by the same form gi, indicates what one equips himself with for some intended purpose, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Aloo dhi nam gi ndoo. ('Aloo is going to the lake with a pail' (e.g. to draw water))</div>
            
            <p><strong>Means</strong> - which shows how one achieves a certain purpose (in expressions which adopt an adverbial strategy for showing it), e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Adhi ikul gi tienda ('I go to school on foot')</div>
            
            <h4>Predictions over Propositions</h4>
            <p>Unlike in the above cases, where the scope of the adverbial element is limited only to some part of the proposition, usually the action or state designated by the verb, in the case we are dealing with now the sentence in question has a whole proposition which can be shown to fall withm the scope of a given adverbial expression. The adverbial functions under this category include:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Factive</strong> - which indicates that a given proposition is believed by the speaker to be a fact, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Kiwacho adieri (to) Jo-Kenya ohero pesa. ('Truly speaking, Kenyans love money.')</div>
            <div class="example">Ka ok ariambo (to) koth biro chwe kawuono ('If I don't lie, it will rain today.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Modality</strong> - which indicates the speaker's attitude towards what he says, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Ka nyalore (to) Onyango biro duogo. ('If (it is) possible Onyango will come back.')</div>
            <div class="example">Ka de to ng√†to de okonyo ng'atni. ('It would be good if someone could help this man.')</div>
            
            <p><strong>Concession</strong> - which introduces a proposition contrary to what should be expected from known facts, e.g.</p>
            <div class="example">Kata aonge pesa to nyaka abed gi ot. ('Even if I lack have money I must have a house.')</div>
            <div class="example">Wayie ni okwelo to ok unyal nege. ('We agree that he has stolen, but you cant kill him.')</div>
            
            <h4>2.5.3 Predictions of Motivations, Conditions and Transition</h4>
            <p>The adverbial functions which fall under this category include:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Purpose</strong> - which indicates the motive or reason for doing something, e.g.</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="example">Ng'atno odere mondo oa e chandruok. ('That man has committed suicide so as to get away from problems.')</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>Cause</strong> - which shows what makes something else happen, e.g.</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="example">Kech nitie nikech piny notho. ('There is famine because the crops failed.')</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>Conditional</strong> - which shows the circumstances which must be fulfilled for something else to take place, e.g.</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="example">Ka oyanya to abiro goye ('If he insults me, I'll beat him.')</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>Transitional</strong> - which marks the change from one state or position to another, e.g.</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="example">Kata kamano to adwa neno jatelo ('However, I'd like to see the boss.')</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Note that transitional adverbs such as the one in (a) often have a concessional function as well.</p>
