      <h2>2.1 Verbs</h2>

      <h3>2.1.1 Introduction to Verbs</h3>

      <p>
        Verbs presuppose the presence of participants (noun phrases) which
        function as subjects and objects of the verb. This criterion works well
        for languages such as English, in which there can occur no sentence
        without a verb. For example, while (a) is a well-formed English sentence
        (b) and (c) not because they are verb-less.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>a) Peter works</p>
        <p>b) *Peter a teacher</p>
        <p>c) *Peter good</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In Dholuo, however, the presence of a verb is not a prerequisite for the
        well-formedness of a sentence. Thus parallel constructions to (a), (b)
        and (c) are well-formed in Dholuo, as the following sentences confirm:
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>
          a) <span class="italic">Peter tiyo</span><br />
          Peter works.
        </p>

        <p>
          b) <span class="italic">Peter japuonj</span><br />
          'Peter is a teacher.'
        </p>

        <p>
          c) <span class="italic">Peter ber</span><br />
          'Peter is good.'
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In this study, two criteria have been applied in a complementary manner
        to tell whether or not a given word is a verb in Dholuo. I.e
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          In their cognitive function, verbs are symbols for events (creations,
          changes of state, processes, actions) for of affairs, and for speaker
          intention and attitude (promises, commands, hopes, expectations).
        </li>

        <li>
          The second criterion, which is based specifically on observations
          concerning Dholuo morphology, is that verbs are characterized by their
          ability formally to show aspectual distinctions tonally and/or
          segmentally.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        For example, by the cognitive criterion above one cannot tell in a
        conclusive manner whether or not the words [fuwo] and [ber] are verbs in
        sentences (a) and (b), respectively.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>
          a) <span class="italic">Juma ofuwo</span><br />
          Juma is-foolish
        </p>

        <p>
          b) <span class="italic">Juma ber</span><br />
          Juma is-good
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        In both cases some kind of state of affairs is expressed, and from the
        English equivalents one even senses some degree of adjectiveness in the
        predicative expressions.
      </p>

      <p>
        But we notice that in (a) the predicate [fuwo] takes a perfective
        morpheme, marked by [o-] while [ber] in (b) does not. We note further
        that [fuwo] can be tonally marked for imperfective aspect whereas [ber]
        remains aspectually neutral, as the following sentences illustrate:
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>
          a) <span class="italic">Juma tinde f√∫wo</span><br />
          Juma nowadays becoming-foolish
        </p>

        <p>b) <span class="italic">*Juma tinde ber</span></p>
      </div>

      <p>
        This kind of evidence shows that the two words belong to different
        classes, one (fuwo) being a verb and the other (ber) an adjective.
      </p>

      <p>
        The grammatical operators which normally satellite around the verb,
        although their real scope may be a larger construction (e.g. a clause)
        include tense, aspect, modality, and negation.
