        <h3>2.6.3 Interrogatives</h3>
        
        <p>The most typical function of the interrogative sentence is to ask questions. 
        It is this function that shall be our concern here. The main question-types in Dholuo are (i) those that seek information and (ii) those that seek confirmation. They include the following:</p>
        
        <h4>Non-Emphatic</h4>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>ng'a [Pl. ng'a gini]</td>
                <td>'who'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ang'o</td>
                <td>'what'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Nade</td>
                <td>'how'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>nang'o</td>
                <td>'why'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dak</td>
                <td>'why (negative)'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Kanye</td>
                <td>'where'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Ere</td>
                <td>'where is'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mane</td>
                <td>'which one'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Adi</td>
                <td>'how many'</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>In addition to these, speakers (depending on personal taste) can form such compound forms as [mar ang'o] 'why (for what)', [nikech ang'o] 'why (because of what)', [mondo ang'o] 'so that what (may happen)', etc.</p>
        
        <p>Generally, the clause patterns for information-seeking questions are the same as the patterns for their corresponding declaratives, the significant difference being that in the former there is a question word filling some structural position.</p>
        
        <p>Placing a question word in preverbal position necessitates the relativization of what comes after it if the information sought by the question word can be given in the form of a nominal (phrase). For example, in the following pairs of semantically equivalent sentences:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p>Ng'at no dwaro ang'o?<br>
            <em>What does that person want?</em></p>
            
            <p>Ang'o ma ngat no dwaro?<br>
            <em>What does that person want?</em></p>
            
            <p>Ere pala?<br>
            <em>Where is the knife?</em></p>
            
            <p>Pala ere?<br>
            <em>Where is the knife?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The information required by (a,b) would normally be given in the form of a nominal, e.g. [odwaro) pesa] '(He wants) money.', while the information required by (c,d) would normally take the form of a prepositional phrase, e.g. (Pala) ni e wi mesa '(The knife is) on the table. This explains why we have a relative clause after ang'o in (b) but not after [ere] in (d).</p>
        
        <p>Representing the Question word with [a] Q, we can, following our observations above, identify some of the relevant clause patterns as follows:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Q V DO</strong>, e.g.</p>
            <p>Ng'a ma kelo koko<br>
            <em>Who is causing trouble?</em></p>
            
            <p>Ang'o ma yiengo ot<br>
            <em>What is shaking the house?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>S V Q</strong>, e.g.</p>
            <p>Juma otimo ang'o<br>
            <em>What has Juma done?</em></p>
            
            <p>Kwach onego ng'a<br>
            <em>Whom has the leopard killed?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>S V IO Q</strong>, e.g.</p>
            <p>Otieno omiyo nyathi ang'o<br>
            <em>What has Otieno given the baby?</em></p>
            
            <p>Ong'iewo ni ang'o<br>
            <em>What has he bought you?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>S V Q DO</strong>, e.g.</p>
            <p>Ikelo ne ng'a gigo<br>
            <em>To whom are you bringing those things?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>S V O Q</strong>, e.g.</p>
            <p>Giyiero Omolo ang'o?<br>
            <em>What have they made Omolo?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>S V Q C</strong>, e.g.</p>
            <p>Onyango oloko ang'o mesa<br>
            <em>What has Onyango converted into a table?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>S P Q</strong> (P = Predicate), e.g.</p>
            <p>Jodongo chiemo kanye<br>
            <em>Where the elders eating?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>S COP. Q</strong> (COP = locative copula) e.g.</p>
            <p>Owadu ni kanye<br>
            <em>Where is your brother?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Q S V</strong>, e.g.</p>
            <p>Ang'o ma ng'at no dwaro<br>
            <em>What does that person want?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>There are many clause patterns for information-seeking questions which we can in Dholuo. The important principle is that in every such construction there is an informational gap which is indicated by the presence of a question word in some position.</p>
        
        <p>Confirmation-seeking questions are formed either (i) by merely expanding the tonal register of a declarative construction, or (ii) by using an appropriate question word.</p>
        
        <p>The key words used in the second strategy are [bende, donge, and koso], all of which ask for the confirmation of an accompanying statement. The defining characteristic of a confirmation-seeking question is that it can be adequately responded to by merely saying either [ee] 'yes' or [ooyo] 'no'. Bende usually occurs either sentence-initially or after the subject, e.g.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p>Bende ng'ato pidho nyathi?<br>
            <em>Is anyone feeding the baby?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>With subjects of more specific reference than [ng'ato], the occurrence of [bende] after the subject (or any other referring expression) may suggest a restriction of the scope of [bende] to the expression in question with the sense of 'as well' added to its general role as confirmation-seeking question word. Thus, for instance, the sentence</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p>Atieno bende biro<br>
            <em>May mean either 'Is Atieno coming? or 'Is Atieno also coming?' (that is, we know someone else who is).</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The important semantic point about [bende] is that it shows only the speaker's desire to know whether the propositional content of the X-element in any sentence of the form bende X (where X is a declarative construction) is or is not the case. For example, the interest of the person who asks the question (as far as we can tell from the wording alone)</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p>Bende joUlaya puro?<br>
            <em>Do Europeans cultivate (their land)?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>is only to know whether it is or is not the case that</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p>Jo Ulaya puro<br>
            <em>Europeans cultivate (their land).</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>On the other hand, using [donge], as in</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p>Donge ubiro<br>
            <em>Aren't you coming?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>suggests not only that the speaker expects the X-element of the sentence [donge] X to be true, but also that he has an interest in its confirmation.</p>
        
        <p>If the speaker does not expect the X-element in any sentence QX? (where Q is a confirmation-seeking question word) to be true, then he uses the word [koso], as in</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p>Koso ubiro<br>
            <em>Might you be coming?</em><br>
            <em>Do you eat fish? (I assume that you do not)</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Thus [koso] has an inherent negative meaning, rather like (though perhaps not to the same degree as) the information-seeking question word dak 'why not', as in the sentence</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p>Dak iwuo<br>
            <em>Why don't you talk?</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Some of the question words, e.g. [donge], are fairly free in their occurrence relative to the other constituents in a sentence. Thus, we can say</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <p>Donge yamo kudho.<br>
            <em>Isn't (the) wind blowing?</em></p>
            
            <p>Yamo donge kudho?</p>
            
            <p>Yamo kudho.</p>
