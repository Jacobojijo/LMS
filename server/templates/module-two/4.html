        <h4>2.2.2 True Reflexive and Reciprocal Constraints</h4>
        
        <div class="subsection">True Reflexive</div>
        <p>The reflexive construction as 'one in which the subject and object refer to the same person (thing)'. In Dholuo, we see them in such construction as:</p>
        
        <p class="example">Dhiang' nang'ore.</p>
        <p class="translation">'The cow is licking itself.'</p>
        
        <p class="example">Jaduong' ohinyore elder.</p>
        <p class="translation">'The elder has hurt himself.'</p>
        
        <div class="subsection">Reciprocal Constraints</div>
        <p>In this kind of reflexive construction, the participants in the given state of affairs do the same thing to one another, as in:</p>
        
        <p class="example">Jokong'o yanyore.</p>
        <p class="translation">'Drunkards are insulting one another.'</p>
        
        <p class="example">Otieno gi Apiyo oherore.</p>
        <p class="translation">'Otieno and Apiyo love each other.'</p>
        
        <p>A word-level structural ambiguity often arises in the interpretation of constructions such as:</p>
        
        <p class="example">Dhok nang'ore.</p>
        <p class="translation">'Cows are licking themselves/one another.'</p>
        
        <p>which admit of either a true reflexive or a reciprocal interpretation as shown in our translation. In such cases, only the context determines what is actually meant.</p>
        
        <h4>2.2.3 Impersonal Constructions</h4>
        <p>Reflexive verb forms are used in Dholuo to make impersonal constructions, in which the emphasis is more on what is done than on who or what does it. Using the words 'actor' and 'event' in their non-technical senses, we may account for such constructions by distinguishing between 'actor-oriented' and 'event-oriented' constructions - avoiding the analogous terms, 'agent- vs. process-oriented', because the words 'agent' and 'process' have strict technical applications in the FG theory.</p>
        
        <p>The opposition between 'event-oriented' and 'actor-oriented' constructions affords us two construction-types, each of which is, at least theoretically, capable of internal differentiation. For example, let us take the following constructions:</p>
        
        <p class="example">Odi mukore</p>
        <p class="translation">'Your house is crumbling.'</p>
        
        <p class="example">Imuko odi</p>
        <p class="translation">'Your house is being knocked down.'</p>
        
        <p class="example">Otieno muko odi</p>
        <p class="translation">'Otieno is knocking down your house.'</p>
        
        <p>As opposed to (c), both (a) and (b) are impersonal constructions. However, (a) is event-oriented and is, in this way, different from (b), which shares with (c) the property of being actor-oriented. But (b) is not actor-oriented to the same degree that (c) is. In fact, one can even argue that between the two actor-oriented constructions above there is still one scale of actor-orientation represented by either (aa) or (bb) below.</p>
        
        <p class="example">(aa) Ng'ato muko odi</p>
        <p class="translation">'Someone is knocking down your house.'</p>
        
        <p class="example">(bb) Jomoko muko odi</p>
        <p class="translation">'Some people are knocking down your house.'</p>
        
        <p>While (b) can be said to paraphrase (aa, bb), both of the sentences are more actor-oriented than (b) because of their explicitness on the class of the actor, which they make definitely [+ human].</p>
        
        <p>It is clear from the above discussion that the event-oriented reflexive construction is just one of the impersonal constructions one can in Dholuo. At the extreme end of this range, one finds more-or-less figurative sentences, such as:</p>
        
        <p class="example">Kong'o madhore ka</p>
        <p class="translation">'People are drinking beer here.'</p>
        
        <p class="example">Tugo tugore ka</p>
        <p class="translation">'People are playing here.'</p>
        
        <p>whose typical communicative roles are (i) to emphasize the event by suggesting that it is taking place in a large measure (sometimes with a tinge of disapproval), and (ii) to be non-committal as to the identity of the actor. Most such sentences (or their propositional contents, to be more exact) can be expressed in an actor-oriented version. Thus, for example, (a) below could also be expressed such as:</p>
        
        <p class="example">Ji madho kong'o ka</p>
        <p class="translation">'People are drinking beer here.'</p>
        
        <p>Finally, we may point out, for the sake of completeness, that the reflexive form of what is normally a transitive verb is usually used to indicate a state of existence in which a particular object may or may not be affected by the action designated by the transitive verb in question. For instance, from the verb [ng'ado] 'to cut' we have the reflexive fom [ng'adruok] which is used in the following sentences to illustrate this point.</p>
        
        <p class="example">Chuma ni ng'adore</p>
        <p class="translation">'This metal can be cut.'</p>
        
        <p class="example">Gini ok ng'adre</p>
        <p class="translation">'This thing cannot be cut.'</p>
