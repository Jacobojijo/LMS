        <h3>2.3 Adpositions</h3>
        
        <h4>2.3.1 Introduction to Adpositions</h4>
        
        <p>Linguistic elements have a certain relationship with the non-linguistic world in which a given language exists. This relationship is generally known as reference, in spite of the definitional problems surrounding the concept. But linguistic elements also have certain relationships with one another in a given utterance. The linguistic forms which serve to indicate such intra-linguistic relationships, especially those between predicators (verbal, adjectival, etc.) and referring expressions are called Adpositions.</p>
        
        <p>They are known as prepositions if they occur before the referring expression in question, and postpositions if they occur after them. Dholuo has only prepositions. The specific relationships usually designated by prepositions in Dholuo include:</p>
        
        <h4>Locative</h4>
        
        <p>Which is marked by a number of lexical elements, the most typical of which is the locative copula [ni] with or without one or more of the elements shown in (a) below. The canonical form of locative phrases with the copula ni is as follows:</p>
        
        <div class="example">â€¦.ni+e(x)+y)</div>
        
        <p>where X is a variable (optional) locative element of greater specificity than ni + e alone, and Y is a referring expression (nominal or adverbial). Examples of constructions which fall into this schema are:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Pala ni ka (ni+Y)<br>
            <span class="translation">'The knife is here.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Rombe ni e pap (ni+ e + Y)<br>
            <span class="translation">'The sheep are in the field.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Chiemo ni e i da (ni+e+X+Y)<br>
            <span class="translation">'Food is in the pot.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>Strictly speaking, only e (the general locative marker) and the X-element can be called prepositions. The first element in the scheme, [ni], is a locative copula, so called because its occurrence is mainly restricted to locative constructions - its other occurrence being only in the phrase [ni gi], as in:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Nyathi ni gi buk<br>
            <span class="translation">The child has a book.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>We regard this element [ni] in the usage illustrated by (a) above as a suppletive form of [bedo] in the infinitival phrase [bedo gi] (to be with) 'to have'.</p>
        
        <p>As we have pointed out in the discussion of verbs, the copulative role of the verb 'to be' (bedo) is normally performed by pronominal forms, a phenomenon known as pronoun support. In some cases, the copula [ni] occurs in the longer element [nitiere/nitie] 'is present'. The distributional relationship of the former to the latter seems to be that of free variation, and only personal taste controls the choice of one as opposed to the other.</p>
        
        <p>Although [ni] is the only non-prepositional element in Dholuo whose occurrence is to a large extent attributable to the locative function (hence the prominence given to it here), we still have to note that the locative prepositions identified in the schema (...ni+e(x)+y)) as e and X can occur with any other verb, depending only on the semantic possibilities of the state of affairs in question. Thus, for example, we can have prepositional phrases such as:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ng'ato nindo e kom<br>
            <span class="translation">'Someone is sleeping on the chair.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Opira Olal e i bungu<br>
            <span class="translation">'The ball is lost in the bush.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>Moreover, the element e is replaced by [kuom] 'on' when Y is a living being (especially an animal or human being) and there is no reference to a specific part of its body. Thus, one says:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ibedo kuom guok<br>
            <span class="translation">'You are sitting on the dog.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ibedoe iw guok<br>
            <span class="translation">'You are sitting on the dog's tail.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>when it matters what particular part of the dog is sat on. On the basis of the above observations, it needs to be emphasized that the scheme for locative phrases given in (...ni+e(x)+y) is relevant only to the cases in which the locative [ni] is present.</p>
        
        <h4>Instrumental</h4>
        
        <p>In which the participant with the semantic function of instrument is introduced by the preposition gi 'with', as in:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Oloo kunyo bur gi beti<br>
            <span class="translation">'Oloo is digging a hole with a matchet.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>As we pointed out in the discussion of adverbials, the preposition [gi] also introduces nominal elements with the semantic functions of:</p>
        
        <p>Means, e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">
            Wadhi Mombasa gi gari<br>
            <span class="translation">'We are going to Mombasa by train.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>Accompaniment, e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">
            Nyathi nindo gi min<br>
            <span class="translation">'The child is sleeping with its mother.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>Equipment, e.g.</p>
        <div class="example">
            Odhi e pwodho gi kweru<br>
            <span class="translation">'He is going to the farm with a hoe.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>Other uses of [gi] will be discussed at various points later when the relevant issues arise.</p>
        
        <h4>Directional</h4>
        
        <p>There is usually no overt marking for direction if the reference is made in not-so-specific terms. Thus, one says:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Dhi nam<br>
            <span class="translation">'Go to the lake.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>but,</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Dhi e dho nam<br>
            <span class="translation">'Go to the lake-shore.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>where [e] is employed as a preposition. Similarly, we say:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Wadhi boma<br>
            <span class="translation">'We are going to town.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>but,</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Wadhi e ofis<br>
            <span class="translation">'We are going to the office.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>It is not possible to state explicitly where the boundary between specific and non-specific lies. The distinction is highly psychological and subject to a lot of individual idiosyncrasies.</p>
        
        <p>When there is a non-place participant filling the direction slot, the element [ir] is used as a preposition, e.g.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Nyithindo dhi ir japuonj<br>
            <span class="translation">'The children are going to the teacher.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Sud ir dhok<br>
            <span class="translation">'Move closer to the cows.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>(said to a herdsman, for example)</p>
        
        <p>But not when the participant in question is inanimate - thus we cannot have constructions such as:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Dhi ir duka<br>
            <span class="translation">go to shop</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            *Sud ir pwodho<br>
            <span class="translation">move to farm</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>It should be noted that the concept of Direction used here (as is conventional in linguistics) refers to the (intended) destination of an action of movement. The non-destination idea of direction as expressed by 'towards' or 'in the direction of' is just one of the concepts captured by the term Direction here. When Dholuo intends to show direction without suggesting destination, it often uses the element [yo/yor] (lit. '(in) the path of), e.g.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Japuonj odhi yo Kisumu<br>
            <span class="translation">'The teacher has gone towards Kisumu.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>The term Direction, however, seems to be worth retaining for both cases since it seems to include destination without being as semantically marked as the latter. Thus, for instance, if a man tells us:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Adhi e chiro (DESTINATION)<br>
            <span class="translation">'I am going to the market.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>we may, in the absence of a better explanation, consider him to be a liar if we have evidence that he does not actually get to the market. However, if he says:</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Adhi yo chiro (DIRECTION)<br>
            <span class="translation">'I am going towards the market.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>we do not necessarily expect him to reach the market but we do not consider him to be a liar if we find him there.</p>
        
        <h4>BENEFICIARY, LOSER, SUFFERER, etc.</h4>
        
        <p>The preposition [ni/ne] is used in Dholuo to mark a set of roles including such ideas as beneficiary, loser, sufferer, etc. The understanding of the specific role in each case depends on the state of affairs designated by, above all, the verbal predicator in question. For example,</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ng'ato ong'iewo ne nyathi pala<br>
            <span class="translation">'Someone has bought a knife for the child.'</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ng'ato Olalo ne nyathi pala<br>
            <span class="translation">'Someone has lost the child's knife'</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            Ng'ato ogolo ne nyathi pala<br>
            <span class="translation">'Someone has drawn a knife to attack the child'</span>
        </div>
    </div>
