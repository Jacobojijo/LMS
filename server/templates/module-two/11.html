        <h3>2.6.4 Imperatives</h3>
        
        <p>Imperative constructions in Dholuo are, as in many other languages, characterized by two structural features, namely (i) the absence of an overt subject, and (ii) the presence of a main verb in the active voice.</p>
        
        <p>The two main communicative functions of Imperatives in Dholuo are to give commands and to make requests (or challenge someone to do something). Each of these functions is indicated in Dholuo by a characteristic modification of the verb form.</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Commands with Liquid, Nasal, Glide, or Vowel-Final Roots</h4>
            
            <p>Commands are formed by using only the verb root if the final segment of the root is a liquid, a nasal, a glide, or a vowel. Thus, we have constructions such as the following:</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) kel<br>
                <em>'Bring.' (kelo 'to bring')</em></p>
                
                <p>b) kel pesa<br>
                <em>'Bring money.'</em></p>
                
                <p>c) Tem<br>
                <em>'Try.' (temo 'to try)</em></p>
                
                <p>d) tho<br>
                <em>'die (tho 'to die')</em></p>
                
                <p>e) a<br>
                <em>'leave (a – to leave)</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>It should be noted that where the root is segmentally identical to the infinitive as in (d, e), only tone and the absence of a subject mark the imperative construction. In this particular example, the tone pattern of the changes from Low in the infinitive form to low-rising, in the imperative form. The same happens in the case of [a].</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Exceptions to Root Behavior</h4>
            
            <p>We should also note two types of exceptions to the behaviour illustrated by (a, e) above, one systematic and the other accidental. The systematic one involves the class of verbs whose roots end in glides. Since Dholuo morpheme-structure conditions do not allow the palatal glide (shown by y in Dholuo orthography) in word final position, y-final roots (or what would be such roots) become vowel final in their command forms, e.g.</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) go<br>
                <em>'Beat (sth.).' (goyo 'to beat)</em></p>
                
                <p>b) go bul<br>
                <em>'Beat the drum.'</em></p>
                
                <p>c) we<br>
                <em>'Leave (sth.).' (weyo 'to leave (sth.)')</em></p>
                
                <p>d) we wach no<br>
                <em>'Leave that matter.</em></p>
                
                <p>e) ka<br>
                <em>'Bite (sth.).' (kayo 'to bite')</em></p>
                
                <p>f) ka lweta<br>
                <em>'Bite my hand.'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The accidental type involves words whose command forms become vowel final as a result of phonological behaviour which cannot be explained in terms of any general phonological rule of the language. A notable example of this is found in the behaviour of the transitive verb [neno] 'to see (sth.)'.</p>
            
            <p>In some morphosyntactic environments the verb final [-o] is the only part of it that is dropped, leaving [nen-] as the root in such forms as [nen-a] 'See me.', [nen-e] 'See him.', etc.; but in some other environments the whole of the second syllable [-no] is dropped, so that [ne]- is the root to which the necessary modifications are suffixed. This is what we have in forms such as [ne-gi] 'See them.', [ne-wa] 'See us.', and the command forms as we see in the following sentences:</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) ne<br>
                <em>'See (sth.).' (neno 'to see (sth.)')</em></p>
                
                <p>b) ne lweta<br>
                <em>'See (look at) my hand.'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>What needs to be emphasized is that both of the two kinds of exception identified above are not exceptions to the general way in which commands are constructed, but only to the manner in which roots are separated from the infinitival suffix [-o].</p>
            
            <p>Since vowel-final roots are in the same class as glide- and nasal-final ones, there are no adverse structural consequences arising from the exceptional behaviour of the words discussed above.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Commands with Obstruent-Final Roots</h4>
            
            <p>The second way in which commands are formed involves those verbs with roots which end in obstruents (or frue consonants). The significant difference between this kind of root and the first type (as far as forming commands is concerned) is that, whereas in the case of the latter (as we saw above) the verb root is unmodified both sentence-finally and when followed by another word (compare the a- and b-sentences of the relevant examples), in the commands formed from obstuent-final roots the root is extended by the suffix -i if no word follows it.</p>
            
            <p>The following examples will make this point clearer. (Compare the a- and b-sentences.)</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) losi<br>
                <em>'Talk!' (loso 'to talk')</em></p>
                
                <p>b) los koda<br>
                <em>'Talk to me!'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) duoki<br>
                <em>'Return (sth.)!' (duoko 'to return (sth.)')</em></p>
                
                <p>b) duok mano<br>
                <em>'Return that one!'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) hobi<br>
                <em>'Pierce (sth.)!' (hobo 'to make a hole int)</em></p>
                
                <p>b) hob piere<br>
                <em>'Make a hole in its bottom (part)!'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) lupi<br>
                <em>'Fish!' (lupo 'to fish')</em></p>
                
                <p>b) lup gokinyi<br>
                <em>'Fish in the morning!'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) wuogi<br>
                <em>'Depart!' (wuok 'to depart)</em></p>
                
                <p>b) wuog sani<br>
                <em>'depart now'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) jogi<br>
                <em>'Get disgusted!' (jok 'be disgusted')</em></p>
                
                <p>b) jog piyo<br>
                <em>'Get disgusted quickly!'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>This second method of command-formation also applies in the case of roots which end in nasal compounds, e.g.</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) nindi<br>
                <em>'Sleep!' (nindo 'sleep')</em></p>
                
                <p>b) nind ka<br>
                <em>'Sleep here!'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) penji<br>
                <em>'Ask!' (penjo 'to ask)</em></p>
                
                <p>b) penj wuoru<br>
                <em>'Ask your father!'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) gangi<br>
                <em>'Pile (sth.) up! (gango 'to pile (sth.) up')</em></p>
                
                <p>b) gang gigo<br>
                <em>'Pile those things up!'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) riambi<br>
                <em>'Tell a lie!' (riambo 'to tell a lie')</em></p>

                <em>'Tell a lie quickly,'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>A further point to be noted is that if there is need to suffix a personal pronoun to the command form of a verb, then the command-form suffix -i is replaced by the given pronominal element, e.g.</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a) penji<br>
                <em>'Ask'</em></p>
                
                <p>b) penj-a<br>
                <em>'Ask me.'</em></p>
                
                <p>c) penje<br>
                <em>'Ask him.'</em></p>
                
                <p>d) penj-gi<br>

        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Commands with Reflexive Verbs</h4>
            
            <p>The third way in which commands are constructed involves verb forms ending in the reflexive element [-ruok.] The command forms of such verbs always consist of a stem ending in [-r] followed by the suffix [–i]. respect to the suffixation of the command-form [-i], the difference between the command-type and others is that it always has the [-i] irrespective of the environment in which it occurs.</p>
            
            <p>This behaviour is illustrated by the following examples in which the [-i] appears in both the [a] and the [b] sentences.</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>tamri<br>
                <em>'Refuse!' (tamruok 'to refuse')</em></p>

            <h4>Plural Command Forms</h4>
            
            <p>So far we have talked only about singular command forms (i.e. those addressed at one individual) and some of what we have said does not hold in plural forms. There is much more regularity in the plural command forms than in the singular ones, giving us only two command-types. The more general type includes commands formed from all non-reflexive verbs.</p>
            
            <p>In this type, whatever the verb, we add the suffix [-uru] to the verb-root in order to form command-form. Thus we have commands such as the following:</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>kaw-uru<br>
                <em>'take (sth.)!' (you-PL)</em></p>
                
                <p>a-uru<br>
                <em>'Depart!' (you-PR.)</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The second type includes all commands formed from reflexive verbs. In this type we add a stem-formative [-e] to the reflexive stem before suffixing the plural marker [-uru]. This gives us command forms such as the following:</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>tamre-uru<br>
                <em>'Refuse!' (You-PL)</em></p>
                
                <p>dembre-uru<br>
                <em>'Be calm!' (You-PL)</em></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h4>Request Forms</h4>
            
            <p>In cases where there is a pronominal suffix as object of the verb, the request-form has the structure (as far as the verb is concerned) Root Pronominal Affix [-e], e.g. (Compare the a- and b-sentences):</p>
            
            <div class="example">

            <p>In the case of consonant-final roots, if there is no pronominal suffix on the verb in question, then the request-form consists simply of the verb root (or reflexive verb-stem) plus the suffix [-ie], as can be seen in the following sentences:</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>lup-ie (kawuono)<br>
                <em>'Please, fish today'</em></p>
                
                <p>cham-ie (rech)<br>
                <em>'Please, eat (fish)!'</em></p>
                
                <p>kaw-ie (mano)<br>
                <em>'Please, take (that one)!'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The optional words (in brackets) in these examples show that it does not matter whether or not something else follows the request-form of the verb it remains the same.</p>
            
            <p>In the case of vowel-final roots, only [-e] is suffixed to the root to form a request-form, e.g.</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>a-e<br>
                <em>'Please, leave!'</em></p>
                
                <p>ne-e<br>
                <em>'Please, look (at this)!'</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>One other way of making requests is by adding the word ane/anena after either a command- or request-form of a given verb. This type of request construction is illustrated by the following pairs of paraphrases:</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <p>mak-ie bada<br>
                mak(ie) ane bada<br>
                <em>'Please, catch my arm!'</em></p>
                
                <p>bed-ie piny<br>
                bed ane piny<br>
                <em>'Please, sit down!'</em></p>

            <h4>Plural Request Forms</h4>
            
            <p>Plural forms of all requests are made by adding the morpheme [-uru] to the relevant request-form of a verb as in the following examples: (Request elements not glossed)</p>
