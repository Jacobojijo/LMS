      "question": "In the sentence “Olum chiwo barua ni wuon-go”, which element represents the terminal complement, and why?",
      "options": [
        "barua — because it's an indirect object",
        "Olum — because he initiates the offering",
        "wuon-go — because it receives the offered item via “ni”",
        "chiwo — because it’s a verb that doesn't require “ni”"

      "question": "What distinguishes “chiwo” from “miyo” in terms of terminality encoding?",
      "options": [
        "Miyo lacks semantic transfer; chiwo implies dual action",
        "Both always require “ni” before any object",
        "Chiwo needs “ni” to show destination; miyo encodes terminality inherently",
        "Chiwo implies reception; miyo only expresses giving to objects"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "‘Chiwo’ often needs ‘ni’ to mark the destination/recipient explicitly, while ‘miyo’ does not."
