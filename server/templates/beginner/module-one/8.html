        <h3>1.6.3 Family Members in Dholuo Culture</h3>
        
        <p>Luo kinship is highly structured, recognizing both nuclear and extended family members. Unlike Western societies where family relations are often limited to immediate relatives, Luo culture emphasizes an inclusive and hierarchical family network where grandparents, uncles, aunts, and even distant relatives hold significant social and cultural roles.</p>
        
        <h4>Core Family Terms</h4>
        
        <p>The immediate nuclear family consists of parents and children, while the extended family includes uncles, aunts, cousins, grandparents, and great-grandparents.</p>

        <h3>The Role of Gender in Kinship Terminology</h3>
        
        <p>In Dholuo, kinship terms are gender-sensitive, meaning that relationships are often specified based on whether a relative is male or female.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>A daughter-in-law is called <em>Migogo</em> when she returns to her paternal home.</li>
            <li>Father-in-law and son-in-law share the term "Law":
                <ul>
                    <li>My son-in-law: <em>Ora</em></li>
                    <li>Your son-in-law: <em>Ori</em></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Generational Hierarchies and Great-Grandchildren</h3>
        
        <p>Luo society recognizes multiple generations beyond grandparents, giving each a distinct label:</p>

        <p>These terminologies reflect deep ancestral connections within the family lineage. The concept of lineage continuity is fundamental in Luo culture, and each generation plays a role in preserving family traditions.</p>
        
        <h3>Polygamy and Multiple Wives in the Luo Family</h3>
        
        <p>Luo culture historically practiced polygamy, which influenced the way wives were classified within the household. The terms used differentiate between first and later wives:</p>
