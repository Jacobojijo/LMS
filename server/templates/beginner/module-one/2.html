        <h3>1.2.2.4 Problem of Pronunciation.</h3>
        <h4>Phonological Complexity in Dholuo</h4>
        <p>Dholuo, as a tonal language, relies on pitch variations and syllable stress to differentiate word meanings. Words like [kendo] and [keyo] exemplify the importance of mastering tonal patterns and accents, as even subtle pronunciation differences can lead to entirely distinct interpretations. This linguistic feature is both a hallmark of the language's beauty and a source of difficulty for learners.</p>
        
        <h4>Key Features Affecting Pronunciation:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Tone: Variations in pitch (high, low, or falling) applied to vowels or syllables influence meaning.</li>
            <li>Syllable Length: The duration of syllable pronunciation (short vs. long) is phonemically significant.</li>
            <li>Syllable Stress: Stress patterns—whether a syllable is pronounced more forcefully—affect interpretation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Case Study on the Problem of Pronunciation</h3>
        
        <h4>Example 1: The Word "Kendo"</h4>
        <p>Kendo has multiple meanings depending on accent and syllable stress:</p>
        <div class="example">
            <ol>
                <li>[Ke-ndo]: The accents on both syllables, with the second syllable -ndo pronounced as strongly as the first ke, results in the meaning "again."</li>
                <li>[Ké-ndo]: A harder accent on the first syllable ké and a softer rendering of -ndo conveys "fireplace" or "stove."</li>
                <li>[K'eee-ndo]: A prolonged first syllable k'eee followed by a shorter -ndo denotes "to marry." This pronunciation requires precision in vowel elongation.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Example 2: The Word "Keyo"</h4>
        <p>Similarly, keyo can be interpreted differently based on syllable length:</p>
        <div class="example">
            <ol>
                <li>[Keyo]: A short, clipped pronunciation implies "to harvest."</li>
                <li>[Ke-yo]: A lengthened first syllable ke and shorter second syllable yo may mean "to spread," "to broadcast," depending on contextual usage.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Linguistic Strategies for Learners</h3>
        <p>To address these pronunciation challenges, learners of Dholuo can adopt the following strategies:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Practice with Native Speakers: Interaction with fluent Dholuo speakers provides real-time feedback on tonal accuracy and accent placement.</li>
            <li>Phonetic Transcription: Use of International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription to visualize tonal and length variations.</li>
            <li>Audio Drills: Repeated listening and imitation of native pronunciation through audio materials.</li>
            <li>Syllable Stress Exercises: Focused practice on distinguishing and replicating stressed versus unstressed syllables.</li>
            <li>Contextual Learning: Incorporating words into sentences or phrases to understand tonal implications in real-world usage.</li>
        </ol>
