        <h3>1.5 Review & Practice</h3>
        <h4>1.5.1 Summary of Numbers & Numbering</h4>
        <h4>Dholuo Numbers and Their Usage</h4>
        <p>Dholuo employs a decimal-based numbering system, reflecting precision and cultural significance in trade, timekeeping, and social organization. Numbers are systematically constructed using an additive approach.</p>
        
        <h4>Cardinal Numbers</h4>
        <p>Basic Numbers (1–10): Achiel (1), Ariyo (2), Adek (3), Ang'wen (4), Abich (5), Auchiel (6), Abiriyo (7), Aboro (8), Ochiko/Ongachiel (9), Apar (10).</p>
        <p>Compound Numbers (11–19): Formed by combining "apar" (10) with units (e.g., Apar gachiel = 11, Apar gariyo = 12).</p>
        <p>Multiples of Ten (20–90): "Piero" is prefixed to numbers (e.g., Piero ariyo = 20, Piero abich = 50, Piero ochiko = 90).</p>
        <p>Hundreds (100–900): Formed using "mia" (e.g., Mia ariyo = 200, Mia ochiko = 900).</p>
        <p>Thousands (1000–9000): Formed using "alufu" (e.g., Alufu adek = 3000, Alufu ochiko = 9000).</p>
        
        <h4>Usage in Sentences</h4>
        <p>Trade & Counting: Jodongo nopidho yiende piero abiriyo (Elders planted seventy trees).</p>
        <p>Family & Social Context: Dhako achiel to gi chuo ariyo (One woman and two men).</p>
        
        <h4>Examples of Quantification</h4>
        <p>Diek (goats): Abich (five).</p>
        <p>Nyiri (girls): Ochiko (nine).</p>
        <p>Mier (homes): Apar gabich (fifteen).</p>
        <p>Nyithindo (children): Apar gachiel (eleven).</p>
        <p>Udi (houses): Apar (ten).</p>
        
        <h4>Ordinal Numbers:</h4>
        <p>Ordinal numbers in Dholuo denote order, rank, and sequence, formed by prefixing mar to cardinal numbers, except for mokuongo (first) and mogik (last).</p>
        
        <h4>Structure and Formation</h4>
        <p>Key Ordinal Numbers: Mokuongo (First), Mar ariyo (Second), Mar adek (Third), Mar ang'wen (Fourth), Mar abich (Fifth), etc.</p>
        <p>The prefix mar establishes relational meaning, ensuring clarity and consistency in sequencing.</p>
        
        <h4>Linguistic and Cultural Relevance</h4>
        <p>Order of Events: Used in storytelling and genealogy (Nyathi mar adek ne ok bedo mangima – "The third child did not survive").</p>
        <p>Rank and Leadership: Expressing hierarchy (Jaduong' mar ariyo no nyalo bedo kaka jatelo – "The second elder may act as a leader").</p>
        <p>Education and Rituals: Essential in classroom instructions and calendrical events (Due mar adek owinjore mondo wapuojre – "The sixth month is suitable for learning from elders").</p>
        
        <h4>Examples in Context</h4>
        <p>Wendo mar ang'wen odonjo ("The fourth guest has arrived").</p>
        <p>Ng'at mar abich ne okonyo nyathi ("The fifth person rescued the child").</p>
        <p>Ok ginyalo bedo mangima e okang' mar ochiko ("They cannot all survive in ninth place").</p>
        
        <h4>Days of the Week</h4>
        <p>The Luo weekly calendar consists of seven days, each rooted in work, economy, and spirituality.</p>
        <p>Wuok-tich (Monday): "First day of work," marking the resumption of labor. (Wuok-tich en ndalo ma jopiny chako tich mar puodho.)</p>
        <p>Tich-ariyo (Tuesday): "Second workday," reinforcing labor continuity. (E Tich-ariyo, jotich nyalo tiyo maler.)</p>
        <p>Tich-adek (Wednesday): "Third workday," a mid-week agricultural marker. (Tich-adek nyalo bedo ndalo maber mar yiero go puodho.)</p>
        <p>Tich-ang'wen (Thursday): "Fourth workday," preparation for market activities. (Tich-ang'wen, jonyuol tiyo e puodho.)</p>
        <p>Tich-abich (Friday): "Fifth workday," a significant day before market interactions. (Joma ok nyal tiyo Tich-abich chalo ni nyalo bedo matuo dala.)</p>
        <p>Chieng' Ngeso (Saturday): Market day for trade and economic transactions. (Chieng' ngeso en ndalo ma ji dhi e chiro nyiepo.)</p>
        <p>Jumapil (Sunday): A rest day dedicated to worship. (Jumapil en ndalo mar duoko piny e kido mar ler.)</p>
        
        <h4>Months of the Year</h4>
        <p>The Luo twelve-month system aligns with the Gregorian calendar, structured through ordinal numeration with Dwe mar (Month of).</p>
        <p>January – Dwe mar Achiel: "First month,"</p>
        <p>February – Dwe mar Ariyo: "Second month,"</p>
        <p>March – Dwe mar Adek: "Third month,"</p>
        <p>April – Dwe mar Ang'wen: "Fourth month,"</p>
        <p>May – Dwe mar Abich: "Fifth month,"</p>
        <p>June – Dwe mar Auchiel: "Sixth month,"</p>
        <p>July – Dwe mar Abiriyo: "Seventh month,"</p>
        <p>August – Dwe mar Aboro: "Eighth month,"</p>
        <p>September – Dwe mar Ochiko: "Ninth month,"</p>
        <p>October – Dwe mar Apar: "Tenth month,"</p>
        <p>November – Dwe mar Apar gachiel: "Eleventh month,"</p>
        <p>December – Dwe mar Apar gi ariyo: "Twelfth month,"</p>
        
        <h4>Time Expressions</h4>
        <p>Dholuo employs a rich temporal lexicon to articulate past, present, and future timeframes.</p>
        <p>General temporal markers include Sani (now), Nyoro (yesterday), Kawuono (today), Kiny (tomorrow), and Orucha (the day after tomorrow).</p>
        <p>The language structures time through a four-part day division: Okinyi (morning), Odiochieng' (afternoon), Odhiambo (evening), and Otieno (night), with additional nuances like Kogwen (early morning) and Dier Otieno (midnight).</p>
        <p>Time expressions follow distinct syntactic structures, such as Nyoro ne oneno wuon-gi ("Yesterday, he saw his father") or Anadhi bang'e ("I will go later").</p>
        <p>These linguistic patterns demonstrate Dholuo's structured approach to temporality, blending sequential logic with cultural context.</p>

        <h2>1.6 General ways of Communication</h2>
        <h3>1.6.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Luo people, have a rich oral culture where communication is deeply intertwined with social customs and etiquette. Greetings (Mosruok) form an essential part of daily interactions, reflecting respect, kinship, and social cohesion. The linguistic structure of greetings in Dholuo showcases temporal specificity, plural distinctions, and an embedded cultural worldview.</p>
        
        <h3>1.6.2 General Forms of Greetings</h3>
        <h4>Temporal Greeting Structures in Dholuo</h4>
        <p>Dholuo greetings are categorized based on the time of day, reflecting the community's structured perception of time. These greetings are marked by verb inflections and pluralization, demonstrating the grammatical complexity of the language.</p>
        
        <h4>a) Morning Greeting (Mos Mar Okinyi)</h4>
        <p>Oyawore – "Good morning" (one person)</p>
        <p>Oyaworeuru – "Good morning" (many people)</p>
        <p>Response:</p>
        <p>Oyawore ahinya – "Good morning very much" (one person)</p>
        <p>Oyaworeuru ahinya – "Good morning very much" (many people)</p>
        <p>The term Oyawore is used exclusively when the sun is rising, signifying the beginning of a new day and aligning with the Luo people's agrarian lifestyle.</p>
        
        <h4>b) Midday/General Greeting (Mos Mar Odiechieng')</h4>
        <p>Misawa – "Good day" (one person)</p>
        <p>Misawauru – "Good day" (many people)</p>
        <p>Response:</p>
        <p>Misawa ahinya – "Good day very much" (one person)</p>
        <p>Misawauru ahinya – "Good day very much" (many people)</p>
        <p>The midday greeting serves both as a general and situational greeting, adaptable across different contexts. The plural form -uru indicates second-person plural, a key grammatical feature in Dholuo.</p>
        
        <h4>c) Evening Greeting (Mos Mar Odhiambo)</h4>
        <p>Oyimore – "Good evening" (one person)</p>
        <p>Oyimoreuru – "Good evening" (many people)</p>
        <p>Response:</p>
        <p>Oyimore ahinya – "Good evening very much" (one person)</p>
        <p>Oyimoreuru ahinya – "Good evening very much" (many people)</p>
        
        <h4>d) Night Greeting (Mos Mar Otieno)</h4>
        <p>While Oyimore can still be used at night, when people are retiring to bed, the phrase changes to:</p>
        <p>Oriti inind maber! – "Goodnight! Sleep well."</p>
        <p>This reflects the Luo cultural practice of acknowledging well-being before parting for rest.</p>
        
        <h4>Farewell and Goodbye Expressions</h4>
        <p>The Luo expression for goodbye, Oriti, carries a deeper meaning rooted in cultural and religious beliefs. The word derives from Rito ("to protect"), implying divine protection. The expressions used vary depending on the context:</p>
        <p>General Goodbye:</p>
        <p>Oriti! – "Goodbye" (one person)</p>
        <p>Oriti uru! – "Goodbye" (many people)</p>
        <p>Context-Specific Goodbyes:</p>
        <p>Oriti idhi maber / iwuoth maber – "Go well, safe journey."</p>
        <p>Oriti inind maber – "Sleep well."</p>
        <p>Oriti idong' maber – "Stay well."</p>
        <p>These expressions reflect the communal nature of Luo culture, where departure is not just a physical act but a moment requiring well-wishes and a sense of mutual care.</p>
        <p>The structure of greetings follows clear syntactic rules:</p>
        <p>Time marker + Subject + Verb + Object</p>
        <p>Oyawore (time) + ahinya (intensifier) – "Good morning very much."</p>
        <p>Subject + Verb + Temporal Marker</p>
        <p>Oriti inind maber – "May you sleep well."</p>
